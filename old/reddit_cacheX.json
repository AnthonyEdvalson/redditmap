To answer this question, the authors construct a data set of all confirmed uses of lethal force by police officers in the United States in 2014 and 2015.

In light of different theorizing surrounding gender and incivility, we examine whether women experience increased incivility from other women or men, and whether this effect is amplified for women who exhibit higher agency and less communion at work given that these traits and behaviors violate stereotypical gender norms. Across three complementary studies, results indicate that women report experiencing more incivility from other women than from men, with this effect being amplified for women who are more agentic at work. Further, agentic women who experience increased female-instigated incivility from their coworkers report lower well-being (job satisfaction, psychological vitality) and increased work withdrawal (turnover intentions).

Freezing biopsy tissue before fixation preserved the anatomy of this structure, demonstrating that it is part of the submucosa and a previously unappreciated fluid-filled interstitial space, draining to lymph nodes and supported by a complex network of thick collagen bundles. These bundles are intermittently lined on one side by fibroblast-like cells that stain with endothelial markers and vimentin, although there is a highly unusual and extensive unlined interface between the matrix proteins of the bundles and the surrounding fluid. We observed similar structures in numerous tissues that are subject to intermittent or rhythmic compression, including the submucosae of the entire gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder, the dermis, the peri-bronchial and peri-arterial soft tissues, and fascia. These anatomic structures may be important in cancer metastasis, edema, fibrosis, and mechanical functioning of many or all tissues and organs.

We report foodsafe oil-based slippery coatings (FOSCs) for food-processing surfaces that suppress bacterial adherence and biofilm formation by trapping residual oil lubricant within these surface cavities to block microbial growth. SS surfaces were chemically functionalized with alkylphosphonic acid to preferentially wet a layer of food-grade oil. FOSCs reduced the effective surface roughness, the adhesion of organic food residue, and bacteria. FOSCs significantly reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation on standard roughness SS-316 by 5 log CFU cm\u20132, and by 3 log CFU cm\u20132 for mirror-finished SS. FOSCs also enhanced surface cleanability, which we measured by bacterial counts after conventional detergent cleaning. Importantly, both SS grades maintained their antibiofilm activity after the erosion of the oil layer by surface wear with glass beads, which suggests that there is a residual volume of oil that remains to block surface cavity defects. These results indicate the potential of such low-cost, scalable approaches to enhance the cleanability of SS food-processing surfaces and improve food safety by reducing biofilm growth.\n\nPersonal anecdote:\n\nAll I can say is my mum was right when she told me not to wash my wok but coat it with a layer of cooking oil after use.

Of 18 ACT-resistant severe malaria cases compassionately treated with DLA, all fully recovered. Of the 18, this report details two pediatric cases.\n\n> Conclusions\n> Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor the commenters saying that this is not new because Artemisinin, the drug used in Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is derived from Artemisia annua, the issue here is resistance to Artemisinin combination therapy, and the fact that the dried natural leaves of the Artemisia plant appear to have overcome this. \n\nThis suggests that there may be something else in the natural leaves of the Artemisia plant that is more than just pure Artemisinin.\n\nFrom the linked university press release article:\n\n> Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant\u2019s leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.\n\nIt's fascinating stuff.

An abrupt population bottleneck specific to human males has been inferred across several Old World (Africa, Europe, Asia) populations 5000\u20137000 BP. Here, bringing together anthropological theory, recent population genomic studies and mathematical models, we propose a sociocultural hypothesis, involving the formation of patrilineal kin groups and intergroup competition among these groups. Our analysis shows that this sociocultural hypothesis can explain the inference of a population bottleneck. We also show that our hypothesis is consistent with current findings from the archaeogenetics of Old World Eurasia, and is important for conceptions of cultural and social evolution in prehistory.\n\n\n", "Journal Reference:\n\nDavid Zendle, Daniel Kudenko, Paul Cairns. \n\nBehavioural realism and the activation of aggressive concepts in violent video games. \n\nEntertainment Computing, 2018; 24: 21 \n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.entcom.2017.10.003\n\nLink: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952117300113?via%3Dihub\n\nHighlights\n\n\u2022 Two large scale online game experiments (total n\u202f=\u202f2778).\n\n\u2022 Behavioural realism does not increase the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs.\n\n\u2022 Challenges theories which assert that more VVG realism leads to greater VVG effects.\n\nAbstract\n\n> A common argument in the violent video game (VVG) literature is that the greater the realism of a game, the more it activates aggressive concepts, and the greater antisocial effects it will have on its players.\n\n> Several experiments have therefore looked into whether the graphical realism of VVGs might influence their effects. These experiments have returned mixed results. However, there are other ways that a VVG can be realistic besides looking like the real world. More specifically, things in VVGs can not only look realistic, they can also behave realistically. It may be the case that this kind of realism leads to increases in the activation of aggressive concepts, rather than increases in graphical realism.\n\n> In this paper, we therefore present two large-scale online experiments (n\u202f=\u202f898 and n\u202f=\u202f1880) which investigate the effects of two different manipulations of behavioural realism on the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs. In neither experiment did increasing realism increase the activation of aggressive concepts.\n\n> Realism is often described as increasing the effects of VVGs.

This quantum electronics component switches electrical current by controlled repositioning of a single atom, now also in the solid state in a gel electrolyte. The single-atom transistor works at room temperature and consumes very little energy, which opens up entirely new perspectives for information technology.\n\n\n> \u201cThis quantum electronics element enables switching energies smaller than those of conventional silicon technologies by a factor of 10,000,\u201d says physicist and nanotechnology expert Schimmel, who conducts research at the APH, the Institute of Nanotechnology (INT), and the Material Research Center for Energy Systems (MZE) of KIT.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nFangqing Xie, Andreas Peukert, Thorsten Bender, Christian Obermair, Florian Wertz, Philipp Schmieder, Thomas Schimmel. \n\nQuasi-Solid-State Single-Atom Transistors. \n\nAdvanced Materials, 2018; 30 (31): 1801225 \n\nDOI: 10.1002/adma.201801225\n\nLink: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.201801225\n\nAbstract\n\nThe single\u2010atom transistor represents a quantum electronic device at room temperature, allowing the switching of an electric current by the controlled and reversible relocation of one single atom within a metallic quantum point contact. So far, the device operates by applying a small voltage to a control electrode or \u201cgate\u201d within the aqueous electrolyte. Here, the operation of the atomic device in the quasi\u2010solid state is demonstrated. Gelation of pyrogenic silica transforms the electrolyte into the quasi\u2010solid state, exhibiting the cohesive properties of a solid and the diffusive properties of a liquid, preventing the leakage problem and avoiding the handling of a liquid system. The electrolyte is characterized by cyclic voltammetry, conductivity measurements, and rotation viscometry. Thus, a first demonstration of the single\u2010atom transistor operating in the quasi\u2010solid\u2010state is given. The silver single\u2010atom and atomic\u2010scale transistors in the quasi\u2010solid\u2010state allow bistable switching between zero and quantized conductance levels, which are integer multiples of the conductance quantum G0 = 2e2/h. Source\u2013drain currents ranging from 1 to 8 \u00b5A are applied in these experiments. Any obvious influence of the gelation of the aqueous electrolyte on the electron transport within the quantum point contact is not observed.\n\n\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, second, seventh and tenth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Scientists have finally found malaria\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, a neurotoxin that isn\u2019t harmful to any living thing except Anopheles mosquitoes that spread malaria.\n\n\n> Progress fighting the disease is threatened as Anopheles develop resistance to chemical insecticides used to control them. \n\n\n> Because the neurotoxin does not affect humans, vertebrates, fish, or even other insects, Gill believes the bacteria that produce PMP1 likely co-evolved along with Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\n\n> These findings also open the door to new avenues of research on additional environmentally friendly insecticides. \n\n  \nJournal Reference:\n\nEstefania Contreras, Geoffrey Masuyer, Nadia Qureshi, Swati Chawla, Harpal S.

Isolation of PMP1 from Paraclostridium bifermentans strains collected in anopheline endemic areas on two continents indicates it is widely distributed. The toxin likely evolved from an ancestral form that targets the nervous system of similar organisms, using a common mechanism that disrupts SNARE-mediated exocytosis. It cleaves the mosquito syntaxin and employs a unique receptor recognition strategy.

Previously, we reported a clinical case of complete sensorimotor paralysis of the lower extremities in which EES restored the ability to stand and the ability to control step-like activity while side-lying or suspended vertically in a body-weight support system (BWS)4. Since then, dynamic task-specific training in the presence of EES, termed multimodal rehabilitation (MMR), was performed for 43 weeks and resulted in bilateral stepping on a treadmill, independent from trainer assistance or BWS. Additionally, MMR enabled independent stepping over ground while using a front-wheeled walker with trainer assistance at the hips to maintain balance. Furthermore, MMR engaged sensorimotor networks to achieve dynamic performance of standing and stepping. To our knowledge, this is the first report of independent stepping enabled by task-specific training in the presence of EES by a human with complete loss of lower extremity sensorimotor function due to SCI.", "Journal Reference:\n\nChung-Ping Liao, Reid C.

In contrast to stem cells in the bulge, the identities of the progenitors and the mechanisms by which they regulate hair shaft components are poorly understood. Hair is also pigmented by melanocytes in the follicle. However, the niche that regulates follicular melanocytes is not well characterized. Here, we report the identification of hair shaft progenitors in the matrix that are differentiated from follicular epithelial cells expressing transcription factor KROX20. Depletion of Krox20 lineage cells results in arrest of hair growth, confirming the critical role of KROX20+ cells as antecedents of structural cells found in hair. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) by these cells is necessary for the maintenance of differentiated melanocytes and for hair pigmentation. Our findings reveal the identities of hair matrix progenitors that regulate hair growth and pigmentation, partly by creating an SCF-dependent niche for follicular melanocytes.\n\nConflict of interest declaration: I'm balding and greying, and so have a real interest in this type of research. :)", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> True helicopter parents talk a good game in making their actions all about their children, but according to one West Virginia University researcher, what they\u2019re doing is reaping\u2014and heaping\u2014the rewards for themselves. \n\n\n> Her research, which focuses on young adults 18- to 24- years-old, indicates that high helicopter parenting leads to \u201clow mastery, self-regulation and social competence.\u201d\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nKristin L.

Because they de-acidify seawater, making it easier for anything with a shell to grow, they are also the key to shellfish production.

Their analysis reveals that if 9% of the ocean were to be covered in seaweed farms, the farmed seaweed could produce 12 gigatonnes per year of biodigested methane which could be burned as a substitute for natural gas. The seaweed growth involved would capture 19 gigatonnes of CO\u2082.

Although knowledge of trends in PDV victimization can help guide programming and health policies, little research has examined whether the prevalence of PDV victimization has increased, decreased, or remained stable over time among non-U.S.-based samples of youth. In addition, few studies have directly tested whether disparities in PDV victimization between boys and girls have narrowed, widened, or remained unchanged in recent years. To address these gaps, we used school-based data from the British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BC AHS) of 2003, 2008, and 2013 (n boys = 18,441 and n girls = 17,459) to examine 10-year trends in PDV victimization. We also tested whether trends differed across self-reported sex. Data from the 2003 to 2013 BC AHS revealed that recent PDV victimization rates had significantly decreased among youth overall (5.9%-5.0%) and boys (8.0%-5.8%), but not girls (5.3%-4.2%). Although boys had steeper declines than girls in PDV victimization rates, year-by-sex interactions indicate that the sex gap in PDV victimization had not significantly narrowed. Moreover, rates of PDV victimization over the 10-year period indicated significantly higher rates of PDV victimization among boys compared with girls. Despite positive declines in recent rates of PDV victimization among youth, important differences in rates of PDV victimization between boys and girls remain. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to sex differences in research and programming and health policies to reduce PDV victimization and the sex disparities therein.\n\n\n", "The interesting parts from the linked article:\n\nWhat is microdosing?\n\n> Microdosing is the phenomenon of taking small, controlled doses of psychedelic drugs \u2014 usually just 1/20 to 1/10 of the sort of dose you would take to go on a magical hallucinatory trip.

It is possible that self-provided misinformation, or lying, has similar effects. We hypothesized that lying impairs memory for younger adults, as increased cognitive control, necessary to inhibit a truthful response, comes at the expense of retaining veridical information in memory. Because older adults show deficits in cognitive control, we hypothesized their memory is unaffected by lying. In the present study, participants made truthful and deceptive responses on a computer while EEG data were recorded. We investigated medial frontal negativity (MFN), an ERP component associated with deception and cognitive control, which may be differentially generated across age groups due to differences in cognitive control. Unexpectedly, results revealed that older adults showed reduced accurate memory for items to which they previously lied compared to younger adults. There were no age differences in correct memory for truth items. We did not find the expected MFN effect, however results revealed long-lasting negative slow waves (NSW) to lie items across age in the pre-response period and following the response cue, suggesting the role of working memory processes in deception.

Previous research showed that writing about one\u2019s worries can help individuals fall asleep. We investigated whether the temporal focus of bedtime writing\u2014writing a to-do list versus journaling about completed activities\u2014affected sleep onset latency. Fifty-seven healthy young adults (18\u201330) completed a writing assignment for 5 min prior to overnight polysomnography recording in a controlled sleep laboratory.

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation.

Neuro-cognitive research has confirmed that glucose, as a main energy substrate for the brain, can momentarily benefit cognitive performances, particularly for memory functioning. However, there is still limited understanding of relative effects of other common sugars (e.g., fructose and sucrose) on cognitive performance. The present study tested in 49 people the effects of three common dietary sugars against a placebo sweetener (i.e., sucralose), on performance of three well-studied cognitive tasks \u2013 simple response time, arithmetic, and Stroop interference, all of which are suggested to rely on the prefrontal lobe. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experimental design was used. Results revealed that ingestion of glucose and sucrose led to poorer performances on the assessed tasks as opposed to fructose and the placebo (p < 0.05); these effects were particularly pronounced under the fasting condition in comparison to the non-fasting condition (p < 0.001). Overall, these results indicate that cognitive effects of sugar are unlikely to be mediated by the perception of sweetness. Rather, the effects are mediated by glucose. Further research should systematically assess effects of dietary sugars on other cognitive domains, such as memory, to give further insights on general cognitive effects of sugar consumption.\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> An international team of researchers led by the University of Tokyo has discovered a new material which, when rolled into a nanotube, generates an electric current if exposed to light.

This photovoltaic effect is particularly important for environmentally benign energy harvesting, and its efficiency has been increased dramatically, almost reaching the theoretical limit1. Further progress is anticipated by making use of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE)2, which does not require a junction and occurs only in crystals with broken inversion symmetry3. However, the practical implementation of the BPVE is hampered by its low efficiency in existing materials4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Semiconductors with reduced dimensionality2 or a smaller bandgap4,5 have been suggested to be more efficient. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are exemplary small-bandgap, two-dimensional semiconductors11,12 in which various effects have been observed by breaking the inversion symmetry inherent in their bulk crystals13,14,15, but the BPVE has not been investigated. Here we report the discovery of the BPVE in devices based on tungsten disulfide, a member of the TMD family. We find that systematically reducing the crystal symmetry beyond mere broken inversion symmetry\u2014moving from a two-dimensional monolayer to a nanotube with polar properties\u2014greatly enhances the BPVE. The photocurrent density thus generated is orders of magnitude larger than that of other BPVE materials.

Three products: formic acid (C1), methylglyoxal (C3), and 2,3-furandiol (C4), are observed at potentials as low as +50 mV vs. RHE, and at the highest half-reaction energy efficiencies reported to date for any >C1 product (99%). The maximum selectivity for 2,3-furandiol is 71% (faradaic efficiency) at 0.00 V vs. RHE on Ni2P, which is equivalent to an overpotential of 10 mV, with the balance forming methylglyoxal, the proposed reaction intermediate. P content in the series correlates closely with both the total C products and product selectivity, establishing definitive structure\u2013function relationships. We propose a reaction mechanism for the formation of multi-carbon products, involving hydride transfer as the potential-determining step to oxygen-bound intermediates. This unlocks a new and more energy-efficient reduction route that has only been previously observed in nickel-based enzymes. This performance contrasts with simple metallic catalysts that have poor selectivity between multi-carbon products, and which require high overpotentials (>700 mV) to achieve comparable reaction rates.", "As the OP, I'm going to point out something significant in this piece of research which is clearly stated in the paper linked itself, and I quote:\n\n> Declaration of interest\n\n> The authors are employees of British American Tobacco or Covance Laboratories Ltd.

Today, researchers from the University of Illinois and U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service report in the journal Science that crops engineered with a photorespiratory shortcut are 40 percent more productive in real-world agronomic conditions.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nPaul F.

Photorespiration deals with these by-products, converting them into metabolically useful components, but at the cost of energy lost. South et al. constructed a metabolic pathway in transgenic tobacco plants that more efficiently recaptures the unproductive by-products of photosynthesis with less energy lost (see the Perspective by Eisenhut and Weber). In field trials, these transgenic tobacco plants were \u223c40% more productive than wild-type tobacco plants.\n\nScience, this issue p. eaat9077; see also p. 32\n\nStructured Abstract\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMeeting food demands for the growing global human population requires improving crop productivity, and large gains are possible through enhancing photosynthetic efficiency. Photosynthesis requires the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), but photorespiration occurs in most plants such as soybean, rice, and wheat (known as C3 crops) when RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP instead, requiring costly processing of toxic byproducts such as glycolate. Photorespiration can reduce C3 crop photosynthetic efficiency by 20 to 50%. Although various strategies exist for lowering the costs of photorespiration, chamber- and greenhouse-grown plants with altered photorespiratory pathways within the chloroplast have shown promising results, including increased photosynthetic rates and plant size.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nTo determine if alternative photorespiratory pathways could effectively improve C3 field crop productivity, we tested the performance of three alternative photorespiratory pathways in field-grown tobacco. One pathway used five genes from the Escherichia coli glycolate oxidation pathway; a second pathway used glycolate oxidase and malate synthase from plants and catalase from E. coli; and the third pathway used plant malate synthase and a green algal glycolate dehydrogenase. All enzymes in the alternative pathway designs were directed to the chloroplast. RNA interference (RNAi) was also used to down-regulate a native chloroplast glycolate transporter in the photorespiratory pathway, thereby limiting metabolite flux through the native pathway. The three pathways were introduced with and without the transporter RNAi construct into tobacco, which is an ideal model field crop because it is easily transformed, has a short life cycle, produces large quantities of seed, and develops a robust canopy similar to that of other field crops.\n\nRESULTS\n\nUsing a synthetic biology approach to vary promoter gene combinations, we generated a total of 17 construct designs of the three pathways with and without the transporter RNAi construct. Initial screens for photoprotection by alternative pathway function under high\u2013photorespiratory stress conditions identified three to five independent transformants of each design for further analysis. Gene and protein expression analyses confirmed expression of the introduced genes and suppression of the native transporter in RNAi plants. In greenhouse screens, pathway 1 increased biomass by nearly 13%. Pathway 2 showed no benefit compared to wild type. Introduction of pathway 3 increased biomass by 18% without RNAi and 24% with RNAi, which were consistent with changes in photorespiratory metabolism and higher photosynthetic rates. Ultimately, field testing across two different growing seasons showed >25% increase in biomass of pathway 3 plants compared to wild type, and with RNAi productivity increased by >40%. In addition, this pathway increased the light-use efficiency of photosynthesis by 17% in the field.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEngineering more efficient photorespiratory pathways into tobacco while inhibiting the native pathway markedly increased both photosynthetic efficiency and vegetative biomass. We are optimistic that similar gains may be achieved and translated into increased yield in C3 grain crops because photorespiration is common to all C3 plants and higher photosynthetic rates under elevated CO2, which suppresses photorespiration and increases harvestable yield in C3 crops.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first, third and fourth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here:\n \n> More youth use cannabis than smoke cigarettes in the United States.\n\n\n> Now, new research led by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania finds that cannabis use among teens does not appear to lead to greater conduct problems or greater affiliation with other teens who smoke cannabis, associations that previous research had suggested to be possible.\n\n\n> Instead, it\u2019s the other way around: It is adolescents with conduct problems or whose friends use cannabis who are more likely to gravitate toward cannabis use.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nIvy N.

Here we elucidate the molecular and neural mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of inflammation on social behaviour deficits in mice. We compared an environmental model of neurodevelopmental disorders in which mice were exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA) during embryogenesis3,4 with mouse models that are genetically deficient for contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2)5, fragile X mental retardation-1 (Fmr1)6 or Sh3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (Shank3)7. We establish that the social behaviour deficits in offspring exposed to MIA can be temporarily rescued by the inflammatory response elicited by the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This behavioural rescue was accompanied by a reduction in neuronal activity in the primary somatosensory cortex dysgranular zone (S1DZ), the hyperactivity of which was previously implicated in the manifestation of behavioural phenotypes associated with offspring exposed to MIA8. By contrast, we did not observe an LPS-induced rescue of social deficits in the monogenic models. We demonstrate that the differences in responsiveness to the LPS treatment between the MIA and the monogenic models emerge from differences in the levels of cytokine production. LPS treatment in monogenic mutant mice did not induce amounts of interleukin-17a (IL-17a) comparable to those induced in MIA offspring; bypassing this difference by directly delivering IL-17a into S1DZ was sufficient to promote sociability in monogenic mutant mice as well as in MIA offspring. Conversely, abrogating the expression of IL-17 receptor subunit a (IL-17Ra) in the neurons of the S1DZ eliminated the ability of LPS to reverse the sociability phenotypes in MIA offspring. Our data support a neuroimmune mechanism that underlies neurodevelopmental disorders in which the production of IL-17a during inflammation can ameliorate the expression of social behaviour deficits by directly affecting neuronal activity in the central nervous system.", "The post title is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here:\n\n> A Kaiser Permanente study of more than 80,000 children born over a 4-year period showed that the prenatal Tdap vaccination (tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis) was not associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in children.\n\n\nNote that the linked academic press release actually links to the wrong paper in JAMA Pediatrics.

This study investigates the association between prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring.\n\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs with deliveries January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Maternal Tdap vaccination from pregnancy start to delivery date was obtained from electronic medical records. A diagnosis of ASD was obtained by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. Children were managed from birth to first ASD diagnosis, end of membership, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2017). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between maternal Tdap vaccination and ASD, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounding.\n\nRESULTS: Women vaccinated were more likely to be Asian American or Pacific Islander, be nulliparous, have a higher education, receive influenza vaccination prenatally, and give birth at term. ASD was diagnosed in 1341 (1.6%) children, and the incidence rate was 3.78 per 1000 person years in the Tdap exposed and 4.05 per 1000 person years in the unexposed group (HR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.88\u20131.09).

We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Cochran, Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases and extracted pertinent information from publications meeting predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to explore the effects of PBHWB on sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, sleep efficiency (SE), slow wave sleep, and subjective sleep quality.

Therefore, more effective human hair growth\u2013modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth\u2013promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non\u2013immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical \u03b2-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this \u2018ligand-limited\u2019 therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, subtitle and first paragraph of the linked academic news article here:\n\n> Water filter inspired by Alan Turing passes first test\n\n\n> Membrane's structure predicted in mathematician's lone biology paper.\n\n\n> Researchers in China have developed a filter that removes salt from water up to three times as fast as conventional filters.

For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization, where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands, which prove to be better for water desalination.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport through the membranes is enhanced.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first three paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> As if being picked on wasn't bad enough, victims of workplace mistreatment may also be seen as bullies themselves, even if they've never engaged in such behavior.\n\n\n> Adding insult to injury, victims may even be seen by supervisors as worse employees, despite exemplary performance.

We tested our predictions across 4 studies. Our first study included 372 leader\u2013follower pairs. Our second study extended to dyadic interactions among employees by using an employee roster method, resulting in paired data from 149 employees (2,184 dyads) across 5 restaurant locations. Our third and fourth studies utilized a policy-capturing design in which individuals provided performance evaluations for fictitious employees.

However, few clinical studies have shown evidence of the stress-relieving effects of cannabis or cannabinoid agonists. In this study, we sought to assess the influence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a main active ingredient of cannabis, upon emotional responses to an acute psychosocial stressor among healthy young adults.\n\n> Methods\n\n> Healthy volunteers (N\u2005=\u200542) participated in two experimental sessions, one with psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) and another with a non-stressful task, after receiving 0 (N\u2005=\u200513), 7.5\u2005mg (N\u2005=\u200514) or 12.5\u2005mg (N\u2005=\u200515) oral THC. Capsules were administered under randomized, double blind conditions, 2.5-h before the tasks began. We measured subjective mood and drug effects, vital signs and salivary cortisol before and at repeated times after the capsule and tasks. Subjects also appraised the tasks, before and after completion.\n\n> Results\n\n> In comparison to placebo, 7.5\u2005mg THC significantly reduced self-reported subjective distress after the TSST and attenuated post-task appraisals of the TSST as threatening and challenging. By contrast, 12.5\u2005mg THC increased negative mood overall i.e., both before and throughout the tasks, and pre-task ratings of the TSST as threatening and challenging. It also impaired TSST performance and attenuated blood pressure reactivity to the stressor.\n\n> Conclusions\n\n> Our findings suggest that a low dose of THC produces subjective stress-relieving effects in line with those commonly reported among cannabis users, but that higher doses may non-specifically increase negative mood.\n", "The relevant and futurology-focused part of the article:\n\n> British billionaire Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Group is one of the backers of OneWeb, an international consortium that aims to begin offering global broadband service as early as 2019.

The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors.

These rings have been variously interpreted as a product of seasonal feasting/ceremonial gatherings, quotidian food refuse generated by permanent dwellers, or a combination of seasonal and perennial activities. Seasonality of shell rings can be assessed by reconstructing the harvest time of oysters (Crassostrea virginica), the primary faunal component of shell rings. We estimated the timing of oyster harvest at St. Catherines Shell Ring (Georgia, USA) by statistical modeling of size frequency distributions of the impressed odostome (Boonea impressa), a parasitic snail inadvertently gathered by Archaic peoples with its oyster host. The odostome samples from three archaeological excavation units were evaluated against resampling models based on monthly demographic data obtained for present-day populations of Boonea impressa. For all samples, the harvest was unlikely to start earlier than late fall and end later than late spring, indicating that shell deposits at St. Catherines Shell Ring formed seasonally with substantial harvesting activities restricted to non-summer months. For all samples, the resampling models indicated that harvesting activities likely occurred during multiple months. However, these analytical outcomes would also be expected in the case of extensively time-averaged records of short-term, non-summer harvest events. Regardless of the exact harvest duration, the results point to seasonal harvesting and suggest that Archaic populations may have opted out of consuming summer oysters to focus on other resources, avoid unpalatable food, decrease pathogen risks, or ensure sustainable harvesting.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first paragraph of the linked academic press release here:\n\n> A UCLA-led team of scientists reports that six people with severe spinal cord injuries \u2014 three of them completely paralyzed \u2014 have regained use of their hands and fingers for the first time in years after undergoing a nonsurgical, noninvasive spinal stimulation procedure the researchers developed.\n\n\nJournal reference:\n\nNoninvasive activation of cervical spinal networks after severe paralysis\n\nDr. Parag GadDr. Sujin LeeDr. Nicholas TerrafrancaDr. Hui ZhongMrs. Amanda TurnerDr. Yury Gerasimenko, Dr. Victor Reggie EdgertonPh.D.\n\nJournal of Neurotrauma\n\nPublished Online:13 Apr 2018\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5461\n\nLink: https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/neu.2017.5461\n\nAbstract\n\nParalysis of the upper extremities following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly impairs one\u2019s ability to live independently. While regaining hand function or grasping ability is considered one of the most desired functions in tetraplegics, limited therapeutic development in this direction has been demonstrated to date in humans with a high, severe cervical injury. The underlying hypothesis is after severe cervical SCI, nonfunctional sensory-motor networks within the cervical spinal cord can be transcutaneously neuromodulated to physiological states which enables and amplifies voluntary control of the hand. Improved voluntary hand function occurred within a single session in every subject tested. After 8 sessions of noninvasive transcutaneous stimulation, combined with training over 4 weeks maximum voluntary hand grip forces increased by ~325% (in the presence of stimulation) and ~225% (when grip strength was tested without simultaneous stimulation) in chronic cervical SCI subjects (AIS B, n = 3. AIS C, n = 5; 1-21 years post injury). Maximum grip strength improved in both the left and right hands and the magnitude of increase was independent of hand dominance. We refer to the neuromodulatory method used as transcutaneous enabling motor control (tEmc) to emphasize that the stimulation parameters used are designed to avoid directly inducing muscular contractions, but to enable task performance according to the subject\u2019s voluntary intent. In some subjects there were improvements in autonomic function, lower extremity motor function and sensation below the level of the lesion. Although a neuromodulation-training effect was observed in every subject tested, further controlled and blinded studies are needed to determine the responsiveness of a larger and broader population of subjects varying in the type, severity and years post injury. It appears rather convincing, however, that a \u201ccentral pattern generation\u201d phenomenon as generally perceived in the lumbosacral networks in controlling stepping neuromodulator is not a critical element of spinal neuromodulation to regain function among spinal networks.", "Direct link to the peer-reviewed paper here:\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2514/1.B36120", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and fourteenth paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> In a Split Second, Clothes Make the Man More Competent in the Eyes of Others\n\n\n> Faces were judged as significantly more competent when the clothing was perceived as \u201cricher.\u201d This judgment was made almost instantaneously and also when more time was provided.

We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (CuB) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (CuC).

The choice of evolutionary models seems to be at the core of the problem because Porifera tends to emerge as the sister group of all other animals (\u201cPorifera-sister\u201d) when site-specific amino acid differences are modeled (e.g., [6, 7]), whereas Ctenophora emerges as the sister group of all other animals (\u201cCtenophora-sister\u201d) when they are ignored (e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11]). We show that two key phylogenomic datasets that previously supported Ctenophora-sister [10, 12] display strong heterogeneity in amino acid composition across sites and taxa and that no routinely used evolutionary model can adequately describe both forms of heterogeneity. We show that data-recoding methods [13, 14, 15] reduce compositional heterogeneity in these datasets and that models accommodating site-specific amino acid preferences can better describe the recoded datasets. Increased model adequacy is associated with significant topological changes in support of Porifera-sister. Because adequate modeling of the evolutionary process that generated the data is fundamental to recovering an accurate phylogeny [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], our results strongly support sponges as the sister group of all other animals and provide further evidence that Ctenophora-sister represents a tree reconstruction artifact.", "Journal article:\n\nIncreased amygdala responses to emotional faces after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression\n\nLeor Rosemana, b, , , Lysia Demetriouc, d, Matthew B.

Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments\u2019 therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.", "The post title is a copy and paste from the title and sixth paragraph of the linked popular press article here :\n\n> What If A Drug Could Make Your Blood Deadly To Mosquitoes?\n\n\n> In their study, the researchers demonstrate that three high doses of ivermectin make human blood deadly to mosquitoes for up 28 days after the third treatment.

The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02511353.\n\n> Findings\n\n> Between July 20, 2015, and May 7, 2016, 741 adults with malaria were assessed for eligibility, of whom 141 were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin 600 \u03bcg/kg per day (n=47), ivermectin 300 \u03bcg/kg per day (n=48), or placebo (n=46). 128 patients (91%) attended the primary outcome visit 7 days post treatment. Compared with placebo, ivermectin was associated with higher 14 day post-feeding mosquito mortality when fed on blood taken 7 days post treatment (ivermectin 600 \u03bcg/kg per day risk ratio [RR] 2\u00b726, 95% CI 1\u00b793\u20132\u00b765, p<0\u00b70001; hazard ratio [HR] 6\u00b732, 4\u00b761\u20138\u00b767, p<0\u00b70001; ivermectin 300 \u03bcg/kg per day RR 2\u00b718, 1\u00b786\u20132\u00b757, p<0\u00b70001; HR 4\u00b721, 3\u00b706\u20135\u00b779, p<0\u00b70001). Mosquito mortality remained significantly increased 28 days post treatment (ivermectin 600 \u03bcg/kg per day RR 1\u00b723, 1\u00b701\u20131\u00b750, p=0\u00b70374; and ivermectin 300 \u03bcg/kg per day 1\u00b721, 1\u00b701\u20131\u00b744, p=0\u00b70337). Five (11%) of 45 patients receiving ivermectin 600 \u03bcg/kg per day, two (4%) of 48 patients receiving ivermectin 300 \u03bcg/kg per day, and none of 46 patients receiving placebo had one or more treatment-related adverse events.\n\n> Interpretation\n\n> Ivermectin at both doses assessed was well tolerated and reduced mosquito survival for at least 28 days after treatment. Ivermectin 300 \u03bcg/kg per day for 3 days provided a good balance between efficacy and tolerability, and this drug shows promise as a potential new tool for malaria elimination.\n\n\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second paragraph of the linked academic press release here:\n\n> This age-related loss of stem cell function can be reversed by a 24-hour fast, according to a new study from MIT biologists.

The role of adult stem and progenitor cells in responding to short-term fasting and whether such responses improve regeneration are not well studied. Here we show that a 24 hr fast augments intestinal stem cell (ISC) function in young and aged mice by inducing a fatty acid oxidation (FAO) program and that pharmacological activation of this program mimics many effects of fasting. Acute genetic disruption of Cpt1a, the rate-limiting enzyme in FAO, abrogates ISC-enhancing effects of fasting, but long-term Cpt1a deletion decreases ISC numbers and function, implicating a role for FAO in ISC maintenance. These findings highlight a role for FAO in mediating pro-regenerative effects of fasting in intestinal biology, and they may represent a viable strategy for enhancing intestinal regeneration.\n", "Journal reference:\n\nMarijuana Use by Breastfeeding Mothers and Cannabinoid Concentrations in Breast Milk\n\nKerri A.

With legalization of marijuana in several US states and a 1990 study in which authors documented psychomotor deficits in infants breastfed by mothers using marijuana, there is a need for information on potential exposure to the breastfed infant. Our objective with this study was to quantify cannabinoids in human milk after maternal marijuana use.\n\nMETHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 50 breastfeeding women who reported marijuana use provided 54 breast milk samples to a research repository, Mommy\u2019s Milk. Concentrations of \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069-THC), 11-hydroxy-\u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol were measured by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry electrospray ionization.\n\nRESULTS: \u22069-THC was detectable in 34 (63%) of the 54 samples up to \u223c6 days after last reported use; the median concentration of \u22069-THC was 9.47 ng/mL (range: 1.01\u2013323.00). Five samples had detectable levels of 11-hydroxy-\u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (range: 1.33\u201312.80 ng/mL) or cannabidiol (range: 1.32\u20138.56 ng/mL). The sample with the highest concentration of cannabidiol (8.56 ng/mL) did not have measurable \u22069-THC. Cannabinol was not detected in any samples. The number of hours since last use was a significant predictor of log \u22069-THC concentrations (\u22120.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u22120.04 to \u22120.01; P = .005). Adjusted for time since last use, the number of daily uses and time from sample collection to analysis were also significant predictors of log \u22069-THC concentrations (0.51; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.99; P = .039; 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15; P = .038, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: \u22069-THC was measurable in a majority of breast milk samples up to \u223c6 days after maternal marijuana use.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the subtitle and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Seven positive childhood experiences are linked to better adult mental health.\n\n\n> Below are the seven items on the positive childhood experience (PCE) psychometric analysis.

The associations of PCEs with D/PMH also remained stable when controlling for ARSES.\n\nMeaning  Positive childhood experiences demonstrate a dose-response association with adult D/PMH and ARSES after adjustment for ACEs; assessing and proactively promoting PCEs may reduce adult mental and relational health problems, even in the concurrent presence of ACEs.\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance  Associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and risks for adult depression, poor mental health, and insufficient social and emotional support have been documented. Less is known about how positive childhood experiences (PCEs) co-occur with and may modulate the effect of ACEs on adult mental and relational health.\n\nObjective  To evaluate associations between adult-reported PCEs and (1) adult depression and/or poor mental health (D/PMH) and (2) adult-reported social and emotional support (ARSES) across ACEs exposure levels.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Data were from the cross-sectional 2015 Wisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, a random digit-dial telephone survey of noninstitutionalized Wisconsin adults 18 years and older (n = 6188). Data were weighted to be representative of the entire population of Wisconsin adults in 2015. Data were analyzed between September 2016 and January 2019.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  The definition of D/PMH includes adults with a depression diagnosis (ever) and/or 14 or more poor mental health days in the past month. The definition of PCEs includes 7 positive interpersonal experiences with family, friends, and in school/the community. Standard Behavioral Risk Factor Survey ACEs and ARSES variables were used.\n\nResults  In the 2015 Wisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Survey sample of adults (50.7% women; 84.9% white), the adjusted odds of D/PMH were 72% lower (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21-0.39) for adults reporting 6 to 7 vs 0 to 2 PCEs (12.6% vs 48.2%). Odds were 50% lower (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36-0.69) for those reporting 3 to 5 vs 0 to 2 PCEs (25.1% vs 48.2%). Associations were similar in magnitude for adults reporting 1, 2 to 3, or 4 to 8 ACEs. The adjusted odds that adults reported \u201calways\u201d on the ARSES variable were 3.53 times (95% CI, 2.60-4.80) greater for adults with 6 to 7 vs 0 to 2 PCEs. Associations for 3 to 5 PCEs were not significant. The PCE associations with D/PMH remained stable across each ACEs exposure level when controlling for ARSES.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  Positive childhood experiences show dose-response associations with D/PMH and ARSES after accounting for exposure to ACEs. The proactive promotion of PCEs for children may reduce risk for adult D/PMH and promote adult relational health. Joint assessment of PCEs and ACEs may better target needs and interventions and enable a focus on building strengths to promote well-being. Findings support prioritizing possibilities to foster safe, stable nurturing relationships for children that consider the health outcomes of positive experiences.", "Original source journal article:\n\nDeep-Time Convergence in Rove Beetle Symbionts of Army Ants\n\nMunetoshi Maruyama, Joseph Parker\n\nCurrent Biology\n\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.02.030\n\nPublished: March 9, 2017\n\nFull text link:\nhttp://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30198-7\n\nHighlights\n\n\u2022Army ant-parasitic rove beetles comprise an ancient system of complex convergence\n\u2022Beetles anatomically mimic and deceive host ants to exploit nest resources\n\u2022Convergent clades arose in the Cenozoic and share a Cretaceous common ancestor\n\u2022Convergence over deep time challenges the notion of evolutionary contingency\n\nSummary\n\n> Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1, 2, 3, 4], but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution [5, 6]. Army ants are ecologically dominant arthropod predators of the world\u2019s tropics, with large nomadic colonies housing diverse communities of socially parasitic myrmecophiles [7]. Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking \u201cmyrmecoid\u201d body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts\u2019 societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood [8, 9, 10, 11]. Here, we demonstrate that myrmecoid rove beetles are strongly polyphyletic, with this adaptive morphological and behavioral syndrome having evolved at least 12 times during the evolution of a single staphylinid subfamily, Aleocharinae. Each independent myrmecoid clade is restricted to one zoogeographic region and highly host specific on a single army ant genus. Dating estimates reveal that myrmecoid clades are separated by substantial phylogenetic distances\u2014as much as 105 million years. All such groups arose in parallel during the Cenozoic, when army ants diversified into modern genera [12] and rose to ecological dominance [13, 14]. This work uncovers a rare example of an ancient system of complex morphological and behavioral convergence, with replicate beetle lineages following a predictable phenotypic trajectory during their parasitic adaptation to host colonies.\n\nThere's a short video in the linked article that you can watch here that provides a nice and succinct summary:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MfXChqG5OeE", "Journal Reference:\n\nCourtney C.

However, no epidemiologic studies have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility and pregnancy outcomes.\n\n> OBJECTIVES:\n\n> We evaluated associations between urinary concentrations of PFR metabolites and outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment among couples recruited from an academic fertility clinic.\n\n> METHODS:\n\n> This analysis included 211 women enrolled in the Environment And Reproductive Health (EARTH) prospective cohort study (2005\u20132015) who provided one or two urine samples per IVF cycle. We measured five urinary PFR metabolites [bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP), tert-butylphenyl phenyl phosphate (tb-PPP), and bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP)] using negative electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Molar concentrations of the urinary PFR metabolites were summed. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the association of the PFR metabolites with IVF outcomes, accounting for multiple IVF cycles per woman.\n\n> RESULTS:\n\n> Detection frequencies were high for BDCIPP (87%), DPHP (94%), and ip-PPP (80%), but low for tb-PPP (14%) and BCIPP (0%). We observed decreased success for several IVF outcomes across increasing quartiles of both summed and individual PFR metabolites (DPHP and ip-PPP) in our adjusted multivariable models. Significant declines in adjusted means from the lowest to highest quartile of \u03a3PFR were observed for the proportion of cycles resulting in successful fertilization (10% decrease), implantation (31%), clinical pregnancy (41%), and live birth (38%).\n\n> CONCLUSIONS:\n\n> Using IVF to investigate human reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, we found that concentrations of some urinary PFR metabolites were negatively associated with proportions of successful fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth.

This study tests whether stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces the likelihood of engaging in aggressive acts, and the mechanism underlying this relationship. In a double-blind, stratified, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, 81 human adults (36 males, 45 females) were randomly assigned to an active (N = 39) or placebo (N = 42) condition, and followed up one day after the experiment session. Intentions to commit aggressive acts and behavioral aggression were assessed using hypothetical vignettes and a behavioral task, respectively. The secondary outcome was the perception of the moral wrongfulness of the aggressive acts. Participants who received anodal stimulation reported being less likely to commit physical and sexual assault (p < .01), and judged aggressive acts as more morally wrongful (p < .05) compared to the sham controls. 31% of the total effect of tDCS on intentions to commit aggression was accounted for by perceptions of greater moral wrongfulness regarding the aggressive acts. Results provide experimental evidence that increasing activity in the prefrontal cortex can reduce intentions to commit aggression and enhance perceptions of moral judgment. Findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of aggression and theoretically have the potential to inform future interventions for aggression and violence.\n\n\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and third paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Early-stage detection of Alzheimer\u2019s in the blood\n\n\n> A team of researchers headed by Klaus Gerwert successfully diagnosed this misfolding using a simple blood test; as a result, the disease can be detected approximately eight years before the first clinical symptoms occur.\n\n \nAnd from the abstract below:\n\n\n> Result\n\n\n> Within a first diagnostic screening step, the structure-based A\u03b2 blood biomarker supports AD identification with a sensitivity of 90%.

Here, we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just before vertebrates began living on land. Computational simulations of these animal\u2019s visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a negligible increase in performance. However, when viewing objects through air, the increase in eye size provided a large increase in performance. The jump in eye size was, therefore, unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a 1 million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The \u201cbuena vista\u201d hypothesis that our data suggest is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system.", "I\u2019ve deliberately linked to the original source journal article that is open access and full-text. \n\nThe title of my post is a cut and paste from the journal article\u2019s abstract\u2019s conclusion:\n\n> Conclusions\n\n> Synthesis of the current evidence does not support the hypothesis that US medical marijuana laws (MMLs) until 2014 have led to increases in adolescent marijuana use prevalence.\n\n\nFor those interested, here is a link to a blog article about the same study:\n\nhttp://blog.norml.org/2018/02/22/meta-analysis-studies-refute-claims-that-medical-cannabis-access-encourages-teen-use/\n\nJournal reference:\n\nSarvet, A.

At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of awarded PhD degrees, which has not been accompanied by a similar expansion in the number of academic positions. In such a competitive environment, an important measure of academic success is the ability to maintain a long active career in science. In this paper, we study workforce trends in three scientific disciplines over half a century. We find dramatic shortening of careers of scientists across all three disciplines. The time over which half of the cohort has left the field has shortened from 35 y in the 1960s to only 5 y in the 2010s. In addition, we find a rapid rise (from 25 to 60% since the 1960s) of a group of scientists who spend their entire career only as supporting authors without having led a publication. Altogether, the fraction of entering researchers who achieve full careers has diminished, while the class of temporary scientists has escalated. We provide an interpretation of our empirical results in terms of a survival model from which we infer potential factors of success in scientific career survivability. Cohort attrition can be successfully modeled by a relatively simple hazard probability function.

Many bodypaintings use white or bright yellow/grey/beige stripes on brown skin. Where the majority of people using bodypainting presently live, blood-sucking horseflies are abundant, and they frequently attack the naked brown regions of the human body surface with the risk of transmitting the pathogens of dangerous diseases. Since horseflies are deterred by the black and white stripes of zebras, we hypothesized that white-striped paintings on dark brown human bodies have a similar effect. In a field experiment in Hungary, we tested this hypothesis. We show that the attractiveness to horseflies of a dark brown human body model significantly decreases, if it is painted with the white stripes that are used in bodypaintings. Our brown human model was 10 times more attractive to horseflies than the white-striped brown model, and a beige model, which was used as a control, attracted two times more horseflies than the striped brown model. Thus, white-striped bodypaintings, such as those used by African and Australian people, may serve to deter horseflies, which is an advantageous byproduct of these bodypaintings that could lead to reduced irritation and disease transmission by these blood-sucking insects.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, second and third paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> A super-thin slice of wood can be used to turn saltwater drinkable\n\n\n> Jason Ren at Princeton University in New Jersey and his colleagues developed a new kind of membrane made of natural wood instead of plastic.\n\n\n> This is more energy efficient and it doesn\u2019t use fossil-fuel based materials like many other membranes for water filtration.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nHydrophobic nanostructured wood membrane for thermally efficient distillation\n\nDianxun Hou1, Tian Li2, Xi Chen1,3, Shuaiming He2, Jiaqi Dai2, Sohrab A.

The primary outcome was efficacy, measured by mean changes in depression score from baseline to endpoint. Secondary outcomes included response and remission rates and quality of life (QoL). Safety was evaluated by incidence of classified adverse events. Heterogeneity was examined using the I2 and Q statistic. Pooled standard mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratios (RRs) were calculated. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted based on type of treatment, type of anti-inflammatory agents, sex, sponsor type and quality of studies.\n\nResults Thirty RCTs with 1610 participants were included in the quantitative analysis. The overall analysis pooling from 26 of the RCTs suggested that anti-inflammatory agents reduced depressive symptoms (SMD \u22120.55, 95%\u2009CI \u22120.75 to \u22120.35, I2=71%) compared with placebo. Higher response (RR 1.52, 95%\u2009CI 1.30 to 1.79, I2=29%) and remission rates (RR 1.79, 95%\u2009CI 1.29 to 2.49, I2=41%) were seen in the group receiving anti-inflammatory agents than in those receiving placebo. Subgroup analysis showed a greater reduction in symptom severity in both the monotherapy and adjunctive treatment groups. Subgroup analysis of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, omega-3 fatty acids, statins and minocyclines, respectively, disclosed significant antidepressant effects for major depressive disorder (MDD). For women-only trials, no difference in changes of depression severity was found between groups. Subanalysis stratified by sponsor type and study quality led to the same outcomes in favour of anti-inflammatory agents in both subgroups. Changes of QoL showed no difference between the groups.

We tried to establish four-type division into distinct chronotypes without implying any chronotypological questionnaire. A community-based online survey (n\u202f=\u202f1305) included a visuo-verbal judgment task for evaluating how sleepy a survey participant thinks he/she would be at different randomly presented times. We predicted that principal component (PC) analysis of 24-h sleepiness curves would yield more than one PC. Consequently, only two types based on PC score would be sleepy in the evening but not in the morning (morning type) and in the morning but not in the evening (evening type), while two other types would be sleepy both in the morning and in the evening and neither in the morning nor in the evening. Results of PC analysis yielded four PCs with the predicted loading patterns.

A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207\u2013222\u2009nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2\u2009mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus.

Different strategies have been developed and still more research is being in progress to reduce the impact of these polymeric materials. This work aimed to isolate and characterize polyester polyurethane (PU) degrading fungi from the soil of a general city waste disposal site in Islamabad, Pakistan. A novel PU degrading fungus was isolated from soil and identified as Aspergillus tubingensis on the basis of colony morphology, macro- and micro-morphology, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. The PU degrading ability of the fungus was tested in three different ways in the presence of 2% glucose: (a) on SDA agar plate, (b) in liquid MSM, and (c) after burial in soil. Our results indicated that this strain of A. tubingensis was capable of degrading PU. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we were able to visually confirm that the mycelium of A. tubingensis colonized the PU material, causing surface degradation and scarring. The formation or breakage of chemical bonds during the biodegradation process of PU was confirmed using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The biodegradation of PU was higher when plate culture method was employed, followed by the liquid culture method and soil burial technique. Notably, after two months in liquid medium, the PU film was totally degraded into smaller pieces. Based on a comprehensive literature search, it can be stated that this is the first report showing A. tubingensis capable of degrading PU. This work provides insight into the role of A. tubingensis towards solving the dilemma of PU wastes through biodegradation.", "The post title is a copy and paste from the first, third and eighth paragraphs of the linked popular press article here: \n\n> Researchers have discovered a way to stop rabies from shutting down critical responses in the immune system, a breakthrough that could pave the way for new tools to fight the deadly disease.\n\n\n> It is hoped that the discovery could lead to new and improved vaccines, including oral vaccines for dogs \u2013 which are responsible for the vast majority of transmissions to humans.\n\n\n> \u201cIf you can get high enough immunity in the dog population, rabies will die out. \n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\n\nStructural Elucidation of Viral Antagonism of Innate Immunity at the STAT1 Interface\n\nHossain, Md.

Because of a lack of direct structural data, these interfaces are poorly understood. We report the structural analysis of full-length STAT1 binding to an interferon antagonist of a human pathogenic virus. The interface revealed by transferred cross-saturation NMR is complex, involving multiple regions in both the viral and cellular proteins. Molecular mapping analysis, combined with biophysical characterization and in vitro/in vivo functional assays, indicates that the interface is significant in disease caused by a pathogenic field-strain lyssavirus, with critical roles for contacts between the STAT1 coiled-coil/DNA-binding domains and specific regions within the viral protein. These data elucidate the potentially complex nature of IFN antagonist/STAT interactions, and the spatial relationship of protein interfaces that mediate immune evasion and replication, providing insight into how viruses can regulate these essential functions via single multifunctional proteins.\n\nMy take:\n\nVery early days of basic research, but this is how discoveries start - by figuring out the fundamentals first.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> The new system, called CRISPR-Cas3, can efficiently erase long stretches of DNA from a targeted site in the human genome, a capability not easily attainable in more traditional CRISPR-Cas9 systems.

These tools employ a single effector enzyme of type II or V CRISPR to generate RNA-guided, precise genome breaks. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using type I CRISPR-Cas to effectively introduce a spectrum of long-range chromosomal deletions with a single RNA guide in human embryonic stem cells and HAP1 cells. Type I CRISPR systems rely on the multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex Cascade to identify DNA targets and on the helicase-nuclease enzyme Cas3 to degrade DNA processively. With RNP delivery of T. fusca Cascade and Cas3, we obtained 13%\u201360% editing efficiency. Long-range PCR-based and high-throughput-sequencing-based lesion analyses reveal that a variety of deletions, ranging from a few hundred base pairs to 100 kilobases, are created upstream of the target site.

Although fortification of food can help treat deficiencies, heat used during cooking and other conditions can degrade vitamins, preventing adequate absorption. Anselmo and colleagues used the polymer BMC to encapsulate micronutrients. Microparticles encapsulating 11 micronutrients showed improved stability against oxidation, heat (such as boiling water used for cooking), and other conditions, and micronutrients were absorbed by the intestine when microparticles were administered to rodents. Data from two clinical trials and experiments using human intestinal tissue demonstrate how microparticle formulations were optimized to enhance iron loading, improve bioavailability, retain stability against cooking, and allow for scale-up. This microparticle platform could help improve oral delivery of micronutrients.\n\nAbstract\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies affect up to 2 billion people and are the leading cause of cognitive and physical disorders in the developing world. Food fortification is effective in treating micronutrient deficiencies; however, its global implementation has been limited by technical challenges in maintaining micronutrient stability during cooking and storage. We hypothesized that polymer-based encapsulation could address this and facilitate micronutrient absorption. We identified poly(butylmethacrylate-co-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate-co-methylmethacrylate) (1:2:1) (BMC) as a material with proven safety, offering stability in boiling water, rapid dissolution in gastric acid, and the ability to encapsulate distinct micronutrients. We encapsulated 11 micronutrients (iron; iodine; zinc; and vitamins A, B2, niacin, biotin, folic acid, B12, C, and D) and co-encapsulated up to 4 micronutrients. Encapsulation improved micronutrient stability against heat, light, moisture, and oxidation. Rodent studies confirmed rapid micronutrient release in the stomach and intestinal absorption. Bioavailability of iron from microparticles, compared to free iron, was lower in an initial human study. An organotypic human intestinal model revealed that increased iron loading and decreased polymer content would improve absorption. Using process development approaches capable of kilogram-scale synthesis, we increased iron loading more than 30-fold.

However, the existence of a clear anatomical asymmetry providing an initial imbalance for normal neural development is still not understood. Using a so-called foveascope, we found that for a cohort of 30 normal adults, the two blue cone-free areas at the centre of the foveas are asymmetrical. The noise-stimulated afterimage dominant eye introduced here corresponds to the circular blue cone-free area, while the non-dominant eye corresponds to the diffuse and irregular elliptical outline. By contrast, we found that this asymmetry is absent or frustrated in a similar cohort of 30 adults with normal ocular status, but with dyslexia, i.e. with visual and phonological deficits. In this case, our results show that the two Maxwell centroid outlines are both circular but lead to an undetermined afterimage dominance with a coexistence of primary and mirror images. The interplay between the lack of asymmetry and the development in the neural maturation of the brain pathways suggests new implications in both fundamental and biomedical sciences.", "Be aware that this won\u2019t appear in /r/science until the preprint paper gets finally published in a peer-reviewed journal because of that sub\u2019s rules.

We investigated whether these effects would be apparent in a clinical trial.\n\n> Methods\n\n> In this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with moderate Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous injections of exenatide 2 mg or placebo once weekly for 48 weeks in addition to their regular medication, followed by a 12-week washout period. Eligible patients were aged 25\u201375 years, had idiopathic Parkinson's disease as measured by Queen Square Brain Bank criteria, were on dopaminergic treatment with wearing-off effects, and were at Hoehn and Yahr stage 2\u00b75 or less when on treatment. Randomisation was by web-based randomisation with a two strata block design according to disease severity. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the adjusted difference in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor subscale (part 3) in the practically defined off-medication state at 60 weeks. All efficacy analyses were based on a modified intention-to-treat principle, which included all patients who completed any post-randomisation follow-up assessments. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01971242) and is completed.\n\n> Findings\n\n> Between June 18, 2014, and March 13, 2015, 62 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 32 to exenatide and 30 to placebo. Our primary analysis included 31 patients in the exenatide group and 29 patients in the placebo group. At 60 weeks, off-medication scores on part 3 of the MDS-UPDRS had improved by 1\u00b70 points (95% CI \u22122\u00b76 to 0\u00b77) in the exenatide group and worsened by 2\u00b71 points (\u22120\u00b76 to 4\u00b78) in the placebo group, an adjusted mean difference of \u22123\u00b75 points (\u22126\u00b77 to \u22120\u00b73; p=0\u00b70318). Injection site reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were common adverse events in both groups. Six serious adverse events occurred in the exenatide group and two in the placebo group, although none in either group were judged to be related to the study interventions.\n\n> Interpretation\n\n> Exenatide had positive effects on practically defined off-medication motor scores in Parkinson's disease, which were sustained beyond the period of exposure. Whether exenatide affects the underlying disease pathophysiology or simply induces long-lasting symptomatic effects is uncertain. Exenatide represents a major new avenue for investigation in Parkinson's disease, and effects on everyday symptoms should be examined in longer-term trials.\n\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Men on Tinder do not appear to be intimidated by highly educated women, according to new research\n\n\n> New research has found no evidence that men have an aversion to a highly educated romantic partner in general.

Here we used \u2019connectome-harmonic decomposition\u2019, a novel method to investigate the dynamical changes in brain states. We found that LSD alters the energy and the power of individual harmonic brain states in a frequency-selective manner. Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality. Beyond the present findings, these methods open up for a better understanding of the complex brain dynamics in health and disease.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Study suggests women dress modestly to defend themselves against aggression from other women\n\n\n> New research in Social Psychological and Personality Science provides evidence that women strategically dampen signals of sexual permissiveness and desirability to avoid provoking intrasexual aggression.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nKrems, J.

However, a major challenge to the concept of 3D tokamaks is that there are virtually unlimited possible choices for a 3D magnetic field, and most of them will only destabilize or degrade plasmas by symmetry breaking. Here, we demonstrate the phase-space visualization of the full 3D field-operating windows of a tokamak, which allows us to predict which configurations will maintain high confinement without magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in an entire region of plasmas. We test our approach at the Korean Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) facility, whose 3D coils with many degrees of freedom in the coil space make it unique for this purpose. Our experiments show that only a small subset of coil configurations can accomplish edge-localized mode suppression without terminating the discharge with core magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, as predicted by the perturbative 3D expansion of plasma equilibrium and the optimizing principle of local resonance. The prediction provided excellent guidance, implying that our method can substantially improve the efficiency and fidelity of the 3D optimization process in tokamaks.\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the second, eighth and tenth paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> They found that globally, gay men are disliked more than lesbian women across 23 countries.\n\n\n> We also found that, in line with previous research, the endorsement of gender norms was associated with anti-gay attitudes\u2014toward both gay men and lesbian women\u2014in every Western country in our sample.\n\n\n> In China and India, the reverse pattern emerged.

This composite contains a small amount of organic material that toughens brittle ceramics, such that a highly regular three-dimensional brick-and-mortar assembly of microscopic mineral tablets is bonded together with biopolymers. Synthetic nacres have not been able to capture the large-scale sliding of the bricks that is key to enhancing toughness. Yin et al. applied this model to toughening glass, where square or hexagonal borosilicate glass sheets were bonded together using ethylene-vinyl acetate interlayers (see the Perspective by Datsiou). This generated a structure that allows glass plates to slide past each other. The resulting five-layered glass composite was deformable and impact resistant, while maintaining high stiffness, flexural strength, surface hardness, and transparency.\n\nScience, this issue p. 1260; see also p. 1232\n\nAbstract\n\nGlass has outstanding optical properties, hardness, and durability, but its applications are limited by its inherent brittleness and poor impact resistance.

This material reproduces the \u201ctablet sliding mechanism,\u201d which is key to the toughness of natural nacre but has been largely absent in synthetic nacres. Tablet sliding generates nonlinear deformations over large volumes and significantly improves toughness.

Electrode arrays for chronic implantation in the brain are a critical technology in both neuroscience and medicine. Recently, flexible, thin-film polymer electrode arrays have shown promise in facilitating stable, single-unit recordings spanning months in rats. While array flexibility enhances integration with neural tissue, it also requires removal of the dura mater, the tough membrane surrounding the brain, and temporary bracing to penetrate the brain parenchyma. Durotomy increases brain swelling, vascular damage, and surgical time. Insertion using a bracing shuttle results in additional vascular damage and brain compression, which increase with device diameter; while a higher-diameter shuttle will have a higher critical load and more likely penetrate dura, it will damage more brain parenchyma and vasculature. One way to penetrate the intact dura and limit tissue compression without increasing shuttle diameter is to reduce the force required for insertion by sharpening the shuttle tip. Approach. We describe a novel design and fabrication process to create silicon insertion shuttles that are sharp in three dimensions and can penetrate rat dura, for faster, easier, and less damaging implantation of polymer arrays. Sharpened profiles are obtained by reflowing patterned photoresist, then transferring its sloped profile to silicon with dry etches. Main results. We demonstrate that sharpened shuttles can reliably implant polymer probes through dura to yield high quality single unit and local field potential recordings for at least 90 days. On insertion directly through dura, tissue compression is minimal. Significance. This is the first demonstration of a rat dural-penetrating array for chronic recording. This device obviates the need for a durotomy, reducing surgical time and risk of damage to the blood-brain barrier. This is an improvement to state-of-the-art flexible polymer electrode arrays that facilitates their implantation, particularly in multi-site recording experiments. This sharpening process can also be integrated into silicon electrode array fabrication.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> UMBC\u2019s Sarah Stellwagen first in world to sequence genes for spider glue\n\n\n> Today in Genes, Genomes, Genetics, UMBC postdoctoral fellow Sarah Stellwagen and co-author Rebecca Renberg at the Army Research Lab published the first-ever complete sequences of two genes that allow spiders to produce glue\u2014a sticky, modified version of spider silk that keeps a spider\u2019s prey stuck in its web.\n\n\n> Better understanding of these genes could move scientists closer to the next big advance in biomaterials.\n\n  \nJournal Reference:\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nSarah D.

The capture spiral silk of classic two-dimensional aerial orb webs is coated with an amorphous glue that functions to retain prey that get caught in a web. This unique modified silk is partially comprised of spidroins (spider fibroins) encoded by two members of the silk gene family. The glue differs from solid silk fibers as it is a viscoelastic, amorphic, wet material that is responsive to environmental conditions. Most spidroins are encoded by extremely large, highly repetitive genes that cannot be sequenced using short read technology alone, as the repetitive regions are longer than read length. We sequenced for the first time the complete genomic Aggregate Spidroin 1 (AgSp1) and Aggregate Spidroin 2 (AgSp2) glue genes of orb weaving spider Argiope trifasciata using error-prone long reads to scaffold for high accuracy short reads. The massive coding sequences are 42,270 bp (AgSp1) and 20,526 bp (AgSp2) in length, the largest silk genes currently described. The majority of the predicted amino acid sequence of AgSp1 consists of two similar but distinct motifs that are repeated \u223c40 times each, while AgSp2 contains \u223c48 repetitions of an AgSp1-similar motif, interspersed by regions high in glutamine. Comparisons of AgSp repetitive motifs from orb web and cobweb spiders show regions of strict conservation followed by striking diversification. Glues from these two spider families have evolved contrasting material properties in adhesion (stickiness), extensibility (stretchiness), and elasticity (the ability of the material to resume its native shape), which we link to mechanisms established for related silk genes in the same family. Full-length aggregate spidroin sequences from diverse species with differing material characteristics will provide insights for designing tunable bio-inspired adhesives for a variety of unique purposes.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the first two paragraphs of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Indiana University researchers have created a powerful new molecule for the extraction of salt from liquid.

This study uses data on 2,194 fathers from a national study on fathers of children aged 2 to 18 and incorporates a comprehensive assessment of masculine norms to examine whether adherence to masculine norms is associated with father involvement and whether this relationship is mediated by fathers' adherence to the new fatherhood ideal that promotes engaged, nurturing parenting. Results suggest that fathers who more closely adhere to masculine norms are less involved in instrumental and expressive parenting and are more likely to engage in harsh discipline than fathers who are less masculine. Adherence to masculine norms also reduces the likelihood of embracing the new fatherhood ideal, and adherence to the new fatherhood ideal at least partially mediates the relationship between masculinity and father involvement. Overall, despite changing expectations for fathers, hegemonic masculine norms continue to shape fathers' behavior.\n\nUpdate - since there are comments asking about the negative aspects of traditional masculinity, the article linked says this:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand what masculinity is and is not,\u201d Shafer said. \u201cIn some circles, when people hear terms like hegemonic or toxic masculinity, they think those are attacking all men. Not so. There are some very beneficial aspects of masculinity \u2014 being goal-oriented or being loyal, for example. However, we are talking about more problematic aspects of masculinity \u2014 like aggression, detached relationships, not showing emotion and failing to ask for help. These are negative aspects of traditional masculinity, and our research suggests it hurts families.\u201d\n\n\n", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title, subtitle and seventh paragraph of the linked academic press release here: \n\n> Stanford researchers develop technology to harness energy from mixing of freshwater and seawater\n\n\n> A new battery made from affordable and durable materials generates energy from places where salt and fresh waters mingle. \n\n\n> Every cubic meter of freshwater that mixes with seawater produces about .65 kilowatt-hours of energy \u2013 enough to power the average American house for about 30 minutes. \n\n  \nJournal Reference:\n\nMeng Ye, Mauro Pasta, Xing Xie, Kristian L.

For every cubic meter of freshwater that mixes with seawater, approximately 0.65 kW h of theoretically recoverable energy is lost. For coastal wastewater treatment plants that discharge to the ocean, this energy, if recovered, could power the plant. The mixing entropy battery (MEB) uses battery electrodes to convert salinity gradient energy into electricity in a four-step process: (1) freshwater exchange; (2) charging in freshwater; (3) seawater exchange; and (4) discharging in seawater. Previously, we demonstrated a proof of concept, but with electrode materials that required an energy investment during the charging step. Here, we introduce a charge-free MEB with low-cost electrodes: Prussian Blue (PB) and polypyrrole (PPy). Importantly, this MEB requires no energy investment, and the electrode materials are stable with repeated cycling. The MEB equipped with PB and PPy achieved high voltage ratios (actual voltages obtained divided by the theoretical voltages) of 89.5% in wastewater effluent and 97.6% in seawater, with over 93% capacity retention after 50 cycles of operation and 97\u201399% over 150 cycles with a polyvinyl alcohol/sulfosuccinic acid (PVA/SSA) coating on the PB electrode.", "The post title has been a cut and paste from the linked popular press article here:\n\n> People with schizophrenia can be trained by playing a video game to control the part of the brain linked to verbal hallucinations, researchers say.\n\n\nAnd here:\n\n> To try to control their symptoms, they were asked to play a video game while in an MRI scanner, using their own mental strategies to move a computerised rocket - and in doing so they were able to turn down the volume on the external voices they heard as well.\n\n\nJournal reference:\n\nReal-time fMRI neurofeedback to down-regulate superior temporal gyrus activity in patients with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations: a proof-of-concept study\n\nNatasza D.

Here, we examined if patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and AVH could be trained to down-regulate STG activity using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF). We also examined the effects of rtfMRI-NF training on functional connectivity between the STG and other speech and language regions. Twelve patients with SCZ and treatment-refractory AVH were recruited to participate in the study and were trained to down-regulate STG activity using rtfMRI-NF, over four MRI scanner visits during a 2-week training period. STG activity and functional connectivity were compared pre- and post-training. Patients successfully learnt to down-regulate activity in their left STG over the rtfMRI-NF training. Post- training, patients showed increased functional connectivity between the left STG, the left inferior prefrontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal gyrus. The post-training increase in functional connectivity between the left STG and IFG was associated with a reduction in AVH symptoms over the training period. The speech-sensitive region of the left STG is a suitable target region for rtfMRI-NF in patients with SCZ and treatment-refractory AVH. Successful down-regulation of left STG activity can increase functional connectivity between speech motor and perception regions. These findings suggest that patients with AVH have the ability to alter activity and connectivity in speech and language regions, and raise the possibility that rtfMRI-NF training could present a novel therapeutic intervention in SCZ.", "The title of the post is a copy and paste from the title and first paragraph of the linked academic press release here :\n\n> Study: Religious fundamentalists and dogmatic individuals are more likely to believe fake news\n\n\n> The study, which appears in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition, suggests that the inability to detect false information is related to a failure to be actively open-minded.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nMichael V.

Consistent with this suggestion, two online studies with over 900 participants demonstrated that although delusion-prone individuals were no more likely to believe true news headlines, they displayed an increased belief in \u201cfake news\u201d headlines, which often feature implausible content. Mediation analyses suggest that analytic cognitive style may partially explain these individuals\u2019 increased willingness to believe fake news. Exploratory analyses showed that dogmatic individuals and religious fundamentalists were also more likely to believe false (but not true) news, and that these relationships may be fully explained by analytic cognitive style.

This style of parenting has been especially highlighted in the lives of young adults, who may be inhibited by this form of parenting in the appropriate development of autonomy and independence. Overparenting shares conceptual similarities with parents\u2019 psychological control practices, which involve emotional and psychological manipulation of children (e.g., inducing guilt, withholding love as a form of control). Although these constructs contain key differences, both have been linked to narcissism in young adults, by way of parental over-involvement in children\u2019s lives. Thus, we sought to explore parental psychological control as a mediator between overparenting and narcissism, including in regard to both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic phenotypes. Participants included 380 young adult college students (age range: 18\u201326 years) who completed the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, as well as reports of their parents\u2019 behaviors related to overparenting and psychological control. Mediation analyses through Process in SPSS supported the hypothesized role of parental psychological control as a mediator between overparenting and narcissistic traits, including traits related to both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Effect sizes for each analysis were modest. This study further clarifies the nature of overparenting, and speaks to the need for further research in establishing the mechanisms by which overparenting may lead to narcissistic traits among young adults.", "Another secondary source here with more info:\n\nhttps://www.panthera.org/sprinting-towards-extinction-cheetah-numbers-crash-globally\n\nOriginal primary source journal article here:\n\nhttp://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611122114\n\nNote that this is a very early edition so the DOI and online version may not be live yet.

Moller-Maersk A/S, says Chinese exports to the U.S. actually grew 5-10 percent last quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to China fell by 25-30 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ironic development,\u201d Skou told reporters in Copenhagen on Wednesday. \u201cBut after Trump has turned up the volume, the U.S. has only increased their imports from China even more.\u201d\n\nThere are two reasons behind the development, Skou said.\n\nFirstly, the U.S. economy is doing well so consumers there have more money to spend on imports, he said. Secondly, a lot of the really big U.S. companies are hoarding Chinese imports to buy as much as possible before tariffs kick in, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk to our customers, we hear from many of them that they want to bring in a lot of goods before the end of the year,\u201d Skou said.\n\nMaersk transports about a fifth of the world\u2019s seaborne manufactured goods, so the company is in a unique position to gauge changes in global trade flows.

Most of the research on this topic has concentrated on wildlife cancer prevalence in environments that are heavily contaminated with anthropogenic chemicals. Here, we propose that human activities might also increase cancer rate in wild populations through additional processes including light pollution, accidental (for example, human waste) or intentional (for example, bird feeders) wildlife feeding (and the associated change of diet), or reduction of genetic diversity in human-impacted habitats. The human species can thus be defined as an oncogenic species, moderating the environment in the way that it causes cancer in other wild populations.

This hitman was especially inventive in his preparatory work, and looking for the perfect disguise was one of his many signature features.

When a male loses dominance or its alpha status, the reverse happens, although the blue ridges remain brightened. There is also a fall in its reproductive success.

She devised a \"blood ritual\" in which the sacrificed (typically a dissenter) was brutally beaten, burned, cut and maimed by all the members of the cult. Thereafter, blood-letting was practiced. The blood was deposited in a cup mixed with chicken blood, after which the victim was made to bleed to death.

The combat lasted all day, and when De Olbing Galley tried to escape in the evening, Wessel set more sails and continued the duel. The fight was interrupted by nightfall, and renewed again indecisively the following morning. Both ships were badly damaged after around 14 hours of fighting, when Wessel was running out of ammunition. He then sent an envoy to the English ship, cordially thanking the English for a good duel, and asked if he could borrow some of their ammunitions in order to continue the fight. His request was denied, and the captains drank to each other's health, before the ships dispersed.\n\n>When he heard about the incident, king Frederick IV of Denmark asked for the admiralty to court-martial Wessel. He stood trial in November 1714, accused of disclosing vital military information about his lack of ammunition to the enemy, as well as endangering the ship of king Frederick IV by fighting a superior enemy force. The spirit with which he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less courageous comrades took the fancy of Frederick IV. He successfully argued a section of the Danish naval code which mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter the size, and was acquitted on 15 December 1714. He then went to the king asking for a promotion, and was raised to the rank of Captain on 28 December 1714.\n\nDude really isn't shy about asking the tough questions.", ">*A previously healthy woman began to hear hallucinatory voices telling her to have a brain scan for a tumour.

After serving nineteen years in prison, Taylor was exonerated after DNA testing proved that neither she nor any of the other five defendants who pleaded guilty in her case were involved in the murder.

Sir Norman Lockyer, an English astronomer, realized that this line, with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers, could not be produced by any element known at the time. It was hypothesized that a new element on the sun was responsible for this mysterious yellow emission. This unknown element was named helium by Lockyer. \n\n>The hunt to find helium on earth ended in 1895.

", "**Short Answer -**\n  \nIn a panic that gripped America, marijuana was banned. The U.S. told other countries they had to do the same. Many countries said it was a dumb idea, and refused to do it. Still the majority of the countries kept the decision under the influence of USA and because there was not any other significant study proving otherwise. Although in recent years many countries have allowed the use of  Marijuana legally.\n  \n  \n**Details -**\nIn 1929, a man called Harry Anslinger was put in charge of the Department of Prohibition in Washington, D.C. But alcohol prohibition had been a disaster. Gangsters had taken over whole neighborhoods. Alcohol \u2014 controlled by criminals \u2014 had become even more poisonous.\n     \nSo alcohol prohibition finally ended \u2014 and Harry Anslinger was afraid. He found himself in charge of a huge government department, with nothing for it to do. Up until then, he had said that cannabis was not a problem. It doesn\u2019t harm people, he explained, and \u201cthere is no more absurd fallacy\u201d than the idea it makes people violent.\n     \nBut then \u2014 suddenly, when his department needed a new purpose \u2014 he announced he had changed his mind.\n   \nHe explained to the public what would happen if you smoked cannabis.\n   \nFirst, you will fall into \u201ca delirious rage.\u201d Then you will be gripped by \u201cdreams... of an erotic character.\u201d Then you will \u201close the power of connected thought.\u201d Finally, you will reach the inevitable end-point: \u201cInsanity.\u201d\n   \nMarijuana turns man into a \u201cwild beast.\u201c If marijuana bumped into Frankenstein\u2019s monster on the stairs, Anslinger warned, the monster would drop dead of fright.\n   \nHarry Anslinger became obsessed with one case in particular. In Florida, a boy called Victor Licata hacked his family to death with an axe. Anslinger explained to America: This is what will happen when you smoke \u201cthe demon weed.\u201d The case became notorious. The parents of the U.S. were terrified.\n   \nWhat evidence did Harry Anslinger have? It turns out at this time he wrote to the 30 leading scientists on this subject, asking if cannabis was dangerous, and if there should be a ban.\n   \nTwenty-nine wrote back and said no.\n   \nAnslinger picked out the one scientist who said yes, and presented him to the world. The press \u2014 obsessed with Victor Licata\u2019s axe \u2014 cheered them on.\n   \nIn a panic that gripped America, marijuana was banned. The U.S. told other countries they had to do the same. Many countries said it was a dumb idea, and refused to do it. For example, Mexico decided their drug policy should be run by doctors. Their medical advice was that cannabis didn\u2019t cause these problems, and they refused to ban it. The U.S. was furious. Anslinger ordered them to fall into line. The Mexicans held out \u2014 until, in the end, the U.S. cut off the supply of all legal painkillers to Mexico. People started to die in agony in their hospitals. So with regret, Mexico sacked the doctor \u2014 and launched its own drug war.\n    \n\u201cThe scientific evidence suggests cannabis is safer than alcohol. Alcohol kills 40,000 people every year in the U.S. Cannabis kills nobody.\u201d\n   \nBut at home, questions were being asked. A leading American doctor called Michael Ball wrote to Harry Anslinger, puzzled. He explained he had used cannabis as a medical student, and it had only made him sleepy. Maybe cannabis does drive a small number of people crazy, he said \u2014 but we need to fund some scientific studies to find out.\n   \nAnslinger wrote back firmly. \u201cThe marihuana evil can no longer be temporized with,\u201d he explained, and he would fund no independent science. Then, or ever.\n   \nFor years, doctors kept approaching him with evidence he was wrong, and he began to snap, telling them they were \u201ctreading on dangerous ground\u201d and should watch their mouths.\n   \n*Today, most of the world is still living with the ban on cannabis that Harry Anslinger introduced, in the nation-wide panic that followed Victor Licata\u2019s killing spree.*\n   \nBut here\u2019s the catch. Years later, somebody went and looked at the psychiatric files for Victor Licata.\n   \nIt turns out there\u2019s no evidence he ever used cannabis.\n   \nHe had a lot of mental illness in his family. They had been told a year before he needed to be institutionalized \u2014 but they refused. His psychiatrists never even mentioned marijuana in connection to him.\n   \nSo, does cannabis make people mad?\n   \nThe former chief advisor on drugs to the British government, David Nutt, explains \u2014 if cannabis causes psychosis in a straightforward way, then it would show in a straightforward way.\n   \nWhen cannabis use goes up, psychosis will go up. And when cannabis use goes down psychosis will go down.\n   \nSo does that happen? We have a lot of data from a lot of countries. And it turns out it doesn\u2019t. For example, in Britain, cannabis use has increased by a factor of about 40 since the 1960s. And rates of psychosis? They have remained steady.\n  \nIn fact, the scientific evidence suggests cannabis is safer than alcohol. Alcohol kills 40,000 people every year in the U.S. Cannabis kills nobody \u2014 although Willie Nelson says a friend of his did once die when a bale of cannabis fell on his head.\n  \n\nThis is why, in 2006, a young man in Colorado called Mason Tvert issued a challenge to the then-mayor of Denver and eventual governor, John Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper owned brew-pubs selling alcohol across the state, and it made him rich. But he said cannabis was harmful and had to be banned. So Mason issued him a challenge \u2014 to a duel. You bring a crate of booze. I\u2019ll bring a pack of joints. For every hit of booze you take, I\u2019ll take a hit of cannabis. We\u2019ll see who dies first.\n   \nIt was the ultimate High Noon.\n  \nMason went on to lead the campaign to legalize cannabis in his state. His fellow citizens voted to do it \u2014 by 55 percent. Now adults can buy cannabis legally, in licensed stores, where they are taxed\u2014and the money is used to build schools. After a year and a half of seeing this system in practice, support for legalization has risen to 69 percent. And even Governor Hickenlooper has started calling it \u201ccommon sense.\u201d\n\n  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n  \nSource - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-influence/real-reasons-marijuana-is-banned_b_9210248.html\n\n\n", "Fun fact : Jack Black used to put wires up his sleeves when he was a kid in the hopes that other kids would notice them poking out and think he was bionic.\n   \n> \"I put wires up my sleeve and I wanted the wires just to peek out a little bit so that if any kids noticed my wires I would say: \u2018it\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing\u2019.

There's a number of ways to make it totally(ish) sterile- gases, steam, dry heat, gamma radiation.\n  \nBut as you ask- the little bacterial corpses are still there. Waiting, one presumes, for tiny necromancers.\n  \nThe problem occurs when you stab someone with the scalpel, preferably in a medicinal way. The bodies immune system works by identifying certain chemical triggers in bacteria, and has no way to know that, for example, the lipopolysaccharide hanging around in someone's heart is not part of a bunch of living bacteria, but the floating corpses of dead bacteria.\n   \nThe dead byproducts of bacteria are called \"pyrogens\" because they cause (among other things, such as death) fevers.\n   \nWhere do they go? Nowhere. Bacteria are small enough that water has completely different properties on their level. Beyond rinsing off gross matter and reducing bacterial load, washing can't do much.\n   \nSo for things like heart surgery scalpels, there will usually be a second step of \"Depyrogenation\" This is the process, not of killing bacteria, but of removing the bits left behind so they don't trigger an immune reaction. This varies widely in complexity depending on what you have to depyrogenate- steel scalpels are easier than an injectable drug, for example. Typically, the goal of the process is to so thoroughly break down the biological material left behind.\n  \n**Are my hands covered in bits of dead bacteria?**\n\nNo your hands aren't covered in dead bits of bacteria.

An example would be Mitch Hedberg's famous one-liner \"I haven't slept for ten days, because that would be too long.\"", "It can be caused by various reasons. Here are some simple explanations.\n  \n It can because your blood sugar drops and you get hypoglycemic which causes the nausea or the puky feeling. When have been hungry for a while our bodies start slowing down to preserve nutrition. This affects blood circulation to put it simply which is why some of us feel light headed, dizzy,etc.\n  \nOr \n  \nIt's can be caused by the acid in your empty stomach. The longer it's been since you ate the worse it can be. By the acid not having anything to digest it causes irritation to the stomach lining and lower esophagus which you feel as a sensation of nausea. This sensation tends to be worse in people with a predisposition to having acid reflux.\n  \nAn actual medical cause can be gastroparesis where the stomach does not empty correctly and can leave food in your stomach from meals digested during your prior meal that adds to irritation.\n  \nIn addition if the nausea is extremely transient, such as a sensation going back and forth between extremely hungry and nauseous quickly, it's likely a caused by a strong signal in the gastric nerves and the limited ability of our brains too correctly interpret this signal. So it is likely trying to interpret the extreme range of human gastric sensation and gets the two confused, i.e. hunger or nausea.\n  \nOr \n  \nWhen your body expects food your stomach releases ghrelin, a hormone that makes you feel so hungry that you get nauseous and feel like you're starving. This reaction is only related to your feeding schedule though, so it'll happen when you might not even necessarily need food. After a while your stomach will stop releasing Ghrelin and the feeling will go away. That could take between 30 minutes to an hour.\n  \nFor instance if you normally ate food every hour, if you missed a meal you'd feel nauseous and super hungry, even though you didn't really need food. Ghrelin encourages you to seek food, but your body stops releasing it after a short while so as not to inhibit food procurement activities. \n  \n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n  \n[Source 1](https://redd.it/1vl3tt)\n  \n[Source 2](https://redd.it/1mu4ex)", "I'm Gonorrhoea-valuate our relationship", "> Kirk Alexander, 47, was found on the ground of his home on Sunday after staff at a Salem Domino's Pizza called 911 when he wouldn't answer his door. \n     \n> Employees at the Salem shop became worried after Alexander - who has been a regular customer for seven years - hadn't called in to the store in nearly two weeks, so they sent a delivery driver to his home to check up on him.\n    \n> Tracey Hamblen, an employee, knocked on Alexander's door on Sunday, just after midnight, but he didn't respond.

But why is sleep so vital to our health? A UCLA-led team of scientists has made a major advance in answering this question and has shown for the first time that a dramatic change in the purpose of sleep occurs at the age of about 2-and-a-half.\n\nBefore that age, the brain grows very rapidly. During REM sleep, when vivid dreams occur, the young brain is busy building and strengthening synapses \u2014 the structures that connect neurons to one another and allow them to communicate.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wake babies up during REM sleep \u2014 important work is being done in their brains as they sleep,\u201d said senior study author Gina Poe, a UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology who has conducted sleep research for more than 30 years.\n\n\nAfter 2-and-a-half years, however, sleep\u2019s primary purpose switches from brain building to brain maintenance and repair, a role it maintains for the rest of our lives, the scientists report Sept. 18 in the journal Science Advances. This transition, the researchers say, corresponds to changes in brain development.\n\nAll animals naturally experience a certain amount of neurological damage during waking hours, and the resulting debris, including damaged genes and proteins within neurons, can build up and cause brain disease. Sleep helps repair this damage and clear the debris \u2014 essentially decluttering the brain and taking out the trash that can lead to serious illness.\n\nNearly all of this brain repair occurs during sleep, according to senior author Van Savage, a UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and of computational medicine, and his colleagues.\n\n\u201cI was shocked how huge a change this is over a short period of time, and that this switch occurs when we\u2019re so young,\u201d Savage said. \u201cIt\u2019s a transition that is analogous to when water freezes to ice.\u201d\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/38/eaba0398", "What he stands for\n\nOn the economy\nCorbyn is opposed to austerity and plans to bring down the deficit by growing the economy and taxing the wealthy instead.\n\nHe intends to introduce a \u201cpeople\u2019s quantitative easing\u201d, which would allow the Bank of England to print money to invest in large-scale housing, energy, transport and digital projects, partly through a national investment bank.\n\n\nCorbyn says he will fund this by reducing the \u201ctax gap\u201d and ending corporate tax reliefs.\n\nOn tax\nCorbyn says there is \u00a320bn in tax debt uncollected by HMRC every year and another \u00a320bn in tax avoidance and a further \u00a380bn in tax evasion that needs to be addressed.\n\nOn education\nCorbyn has proposed a National Education Service, which he says would be \u201cevery bit as vital and as free at the point of use as our NHS\u201d. The service would begin with universal childcare, give more power to local authorities, rethink the role of free schools and academies, introduce a minimum wage for apprentices and put more money into adult learning.\n\nCorbyn has said he will also look at abolishing the charitable status of private schools but admitted it would be \u201cvery difficult to do\u201d.\n\nHe wants to scrap tuition fees and restore student maintenance grants. This will be funded by increasing national insurance on those earning more than \u00a350,000 a year and increasing corporation tax by 2.5%, or by slowing the pace of deficit reduction.\n\nHe has apologised to students who have had to pay fees because of Labour.\n\nI want to apologise on behalf of the Labour party to the last generation of students for the imposition of fees, top-up fees and the replacement of grants with loans by previous Labour governments. I opposed those changes at the time \u2013 as did many others \u2013 and now we have an opportunity to change course.\n\nOn housing\nCorbyn would introduce rent controls in expensive places like central London so that families on welfare are not pushed out of the area, which he says is an example of \u201csocial cleansing\u201d. He will also suspend council right-to-buy schemes in such areas and will lift borrowing restrictions on councils so that they can build more than half of the 250,000 new homes he says are needed each year.\n\nCorbyn has proposed the idea of linking private rents to local average earnings and introducing a right to buy for private tenants of large-scale landlords, a scheme that would be funded by withdrawing some of the \u00a314bn of tax allowances given to buy-to-let landlords.\n\nOn immigration\nCorbyn has consistently argued that immigration is not a drain on the economy and has campaigned on behalf of asylum seekers, most recently over the need to rescue Mediterranean refugees. He has said the debate on immigration has been \u201cpoisoned\u201d and that migration is a global phenomenon that has been going on for hundreds of years.\n\nOn welfare\nCorbyn was one of the 48 Labour rebels who defied the party whip and voted against the government\u2019s welfare reform bill. He said:\n\nWe are one of the richest countries in the world and there is absolutely no reason why anyone should have to live in poverty.\n\nOn defence\n\n\nCorbyn intends to withdraw from Nato and opposes the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.\n\nHe is in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament and has called for a \u201cradically different international policy\u201d based on \u201cpolitical and not military solutions\u201d.\n\nHe has indicated that he would block any attempt by David Cameron to launch airstrikes in Syria, stating that bombing the country will \u201ckill many people\u201d and may not defeat Isis. Cutting off the supply of money and arms to Isis from \u201csome of our supposed allies in the region\u201d would be more effective, he added.\n\nOn public ownership\nCorbyn plans to renationalise the energy companies to bring energy prices back down. He said privatisation of the sector has created a \u201cfalse market\u201d which allows for a great deal of money to be made by gas and electricity companies at the expense of everyone else.\n\nCorbyn also plans to renationalise the railways, which he says will allow the public to \u201cget the benefit\u201d of the current investment in infrastructure. He said:\n\nI believe in public ownership, but I have never favoured the remote nationalised model of the postwar era. Like a majority of the population and a majority of even Tory voters, I want the railways back in public ownership. But public control should mean just that: so we should have passengers, rail workers and government too, cooperatively running the railways ... in our interests and not for private profit.\n\nOn Europe\nCorbyn has indicated that he is likely to support the campaign to stay in the European Union, but has refused to rule out campaigning for a no vote because:\n\nCameron quite clearly follows an agenda which is about trading away workers\u2019 rights ... environment protection ... much of what is in the social chapter.\n\nHe maintains that Britain should play a crucial role in Europe by making demands on issues such as workers\u2019 rights, the environment, tax and wage protection \u201crather than saying blanketly we\u2019re going to support whatever Cameron comes out with whenever he finally decides to hold this referendum\u201d.\n\nWhen pressed, Corbyn has said his preferred position is to stay in a reformed EU. But he has also cited the union\u2019s treatment of Greece as a justification for potential exit. He said:\n\nLook at it another way: if we allow unaccountable forces to destroy an economy like Greece, when all that bailout money isn\u2019t going to the Greek people, it\u2019s going to carious banks all across Europe, then I think we need to think very, very carefully about what role [the EU] are playing and what role we are playing in that.\n\nOn healthcare\nCorbyn has promised a \u201cfully funded NHS, integrated with social care, with an end to privatisation in health\u201d. His website states that the \u201cprinciple of universal healthcare which is free at the point of use is something that we all deserve and should be absolutely protected.\u201d\n\nCorbyn has also pledged to tackle the \u201cmental health crisis\u201d and improve mental health coverage in the country. He will grow rather than cut mental health budgets and ensure mental health education is taught in schools.\n\nOn the monarchy\nThough Corbyn is a republican, he has said abolishing the monarchy is \u201cnot the fight I\u2019m going to fight\u201d due to huge public support for the royal family.\n\nOn the arts\nCorbyn has said he will create a cabinet committee for the arts and creative industries to bring ministers from across the departments together, making policy more effective.\n\nOn gender equality\nAdvertisement\n\nCorbyn has pledged to do more to address discrimination in the workplace, at home and on the streets. He has called for an end to the cuts to public services and welfare that drive women and families into poverty, including the cuts to women\u2019s refuges and services for domestic violence.\n\nHe also wants all companies to publish details of their equal pay arrangements, intends his cabinet to be made up of 50% women and wants to \u201cwork towards\u201d 50% of all Labour MPs being women.\n\nCorbyn has floated the idea of reintroducing women-only carriages on trains to cut sexual assault cases. He says this is not his preferred choice but he will consult women on the proposal after being contacted by women lobbyists.\n\nOn foreign policy\nCorbyn was opposed to the Iraq war and has suggested that Tony Blair should stand trial as a war criminal over it.\n\nCorbyn has hinted that Britain should seek greater diplomatic relations with Russia. He previously described the Kremlin\u2019s state propaganda channel Russia Today as \u201cmore objective on Libya than most\u201d and believes that the Ukraine crisis was caused by the west and Nato.\n\nRussia has gone way beyond its legal powers to use bases in the Crimea. Sending unidentified forces into another country is clearly a violation of that country\u2019s sovereignty [...] Still, the hypocrisy of the west remains unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cNato has sought to expand since the end of the cold war. It has increased its military capability and expenditure. It operates way beyond its original 1948 area and its attempt to encircle Russia is one of the big threats of our time.\n\nCorbyn has also said he supports Israel\u2019s right to exist but opposes what he describes as the country\u2019s \u201coccupation policies\u201d. He has reportedly attended an event in the past hosted by a Holocaust denier and has been criticised for describing Hamas and Hezbollah as friends, which he says was a throwaway word he used to create an amicable atmosphere during discussions. \u201cYou don\u2019t make peace unless you talk to everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/what-does-jeremy-corbyn-think\n\nEdit.Thanks for the gold.", "Before she enters the room your having sex in , hide behind the door, when she walks past ,jump out and then smash a plate over her ..this always works wonders for me and gets me in the mood.", "A study conducted by Hiroshima University researchers found that using Ultraviolet C light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers which is safer to use around humans effectively kills SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 the first research in the world to prove its efficacy against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nOther studies involving 222 nm UVC, also known as Far-UVC, have so far only looked at its potency in eradicating seasonal coronaviruses that are structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 but not on the COVID-19-causing virus itself.

This damaging burst of UV radiation occurred as part of one of the Earth's climate cycles, rather than being caused by a huge volcanic eruption\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/22/eaba0768", "Widespread antibiotic use is largely to blame for the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, which is currently one of the biggest threats to global health. Not only does antibiotic resistance already cause an estimated 700,000 deaths a year, it\u2019s also made numerous infections, including pneumonia, tuberculosis, and gonorrhoea, harder to treat. Without knowing how to stop bacteria from developing antibiotic resistance, it\u2019s predicted that preventable diseases could cause 10m deaths a year by 2050.\n\nSome of the ways that bacteria become resistant to antibiotics is through changes in the bacteria\u2019s genome. For example, bacteria can pump the antibiotics out, or they can break the antibiotics down. They can also stop growing and divide, which makes them difficult to spot for the immune system.\n\nHowever, our research has focused on another little known method that bacteria use to become antibiotic resistant. We have directly shown that bacteria can \u201cchange shape\u201d in the human body to avoid being targeted by antibiotics \u2013 a process that requires no genetic changes for the bacteria to continue growing.\n\nVirtually all bacteria are surrounded by a structure called the cell wall. The wall is like a thick jacket which protects against environmental stresses and prevents the cell from bursting. It gives bacteria a regular shape (for example, a rod or a sphere), and helps them divide efficiently.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12359-3", "The English longbow was a powerful medieval weapon said to be able to pierce an opponent's armor and may have been a decisive factor in several key military victories, most notably the Battle of Agincourt. A recent paper published in the Antiquaries Journal by a team of archaeologists at the University of Exeter in the UK has yielded evidence that longbow arrows created similar wounds to modern-day gunshot wounds and were capable of penetrating through long bones.\n\nHistorians continue to debate just how effective the longbow was in battle.

Beginning in the 1960s, industrial chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\u2014pervasive in refrigeration, personal-care aerosol sprays, and insulating materials\u2014reached the atmosphere, and their highly reactive chlorine began to destroy ozone, creating a massive hole. In the spring especially, concentrated pockets of cold air break down atmospheric CFCs, releasing chlorine that\u2019s then activated by the energy of the sun.\n\nThe ozone hole not only let through UV radiation, it also changed major features of how heat and moisture circulate in the Southern Hemisphere. UV rays cause the ozone layer to heat up, therefore less ozone means less heating. The springtime stratosphere cooled by as much as 7\u00b0 Celsius through the 1990s, throwing off the temperature balance between Antarctica and mid-latitude areas of the Earth and pushing the southern jet stream about 2\u00b0 of latitude closer to the South Pole.

One group of baboons can range anywhere from 20 to 100 primates.\n\nAnthropologists observed baboon mothers in the Namibian desert carrying dead infants for varying lengths of time, ranging from one hour to ten days, with the average length being three to four days. During this time the mother grooms the dead infant frequently.\n\nLead author, Dr Alecia Carter (UCL Anthropology and Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier), said: \"There are numerous hypotheses to explain primate responses to dead infants. Perhaps the strongest hypothesis is that carrying after death is an extension of nurturing behaviour.\n\n\"We are not suggesting that the mothers are unaware that their infants are dead, but there is such strong selection on mother-infant bond formation that, once formed, the bond is difficult to break. It's less clear why only some mothers carry or protect their dead infant, but I suspect that a range of factors influence this behaviour.\"\n\nWhile there are a number of hypotheses, the researchers believe the most plausible are the 'grief-management hypothesis', which suggests that mothers carry the dead infant as a way of dealing emotionally with their loss, and the 'social-bonds hypothesis' which suggests that mothers carry their infants because of the intense social bond mothers and infants share during life.\n\nhttps://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.192206", "As the flu season approaches, a strained public health system may have a surprising ally \u2014 the common cold virus.\n\nRhinovirus, the most frequent cause of common colds, can prevent the flu virus from infecting airways by jumpstarting the body\u2019s antiviral defenses, Yale researchers report Sept. 4 in the journal The Lancet Microbe.\n\nThe findings help answer a mystery surrounding the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic: An expected surge in swine flu cases never materialized in Europe during the fall, a period when the common cold becomes widespread.\n\nA Yale team led by Dr. Ellen Foxman studied three years of clinical data from more than 13,000 patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital with symptoms of respiratory infection.

That approach has had mixed results in treating various conditions, including depression. Frohlich's tACS paradigm is newer and has not been investigated as thoroughly as tDCS. Frohlich's approach focuses on each individual's specific alpha oscillations, which appear as waves between 8 and 12 Hertz on an electroencephalogram (EEG). The waves in this range rise in predominance when we close our eyes and daydream, meditate, or conjure ideas - essentially when our brains shut out sensory stimuli, such as what we see, feel, and hear.\n\nPrevious research showed that people with depression featured imbalanced alpha oscillations; the waves were overactive in the left frontal cortex. Frohlich thought his team could target these oscillations to bring them back in synch with the alpha oscillations in the right frontal cortex. And if Frohlich's team could achieve that, then maybe depression symptoms would be decreased.\n\nHis lab recruited 32 people diagnosed with depression and surveyed each participant before the study, according to the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a standard measure of depression.\n\nThe participants were then separated into three groups. One group received the sham placebo stimulation - a brief electrical stimulus to mimic the sensation at the beginning of a tACS session. A control group received a 40-Hertz tACS intervention, well outside the range that the researchers thought would affect alpha oscillations. A third group received the treatment intervention - a 10-Hertz tACS electrical current that targeted each individual's naturally occurring alpha waves. Each person underwent their invention for 40 minutes on five consecutive days. None of the participants knew which group they were in, and neither did the researchers, making this a randomized double-blinded clinical study - the gold standard in biomedical research. Each participant took the MADRS immediately following the five-day regimen, at two weeks, and again at four weeks.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0439-0", "\nAir pollution causes a \u201chuge\u201d reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.\n\nThe research was conducted in China but is relevant across the world, with 95% of the global population breathing unsafe air.

Can you ever fully turn off, tune out and drop back in again?\n\nAccording to a new review of studies published online in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, the answer might be no, dude. Researchers found that individuals who took even a single dose of psychedelic drugs like LSD, \"magic\" mushrooms and ayahuasca could experience sustained personality changes that lasted several weeks, months or even years \u2014 but oftentimes, these changes were for the better. [11 Trippy Facts About 'Magic' Mushrooms]\n\nIn the new meta-analysis, researchers from Spain and Brazil looked at the results of 18 previous studies, published between 1985 and 2016, linking psychedelic drug use and personality changes. The researchers focused on papers that looked specifically at serotonergic drugs, or drugs that have structures similar to that of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which helps regulate mood, appetite and various other functions. Such substances bind with serotonin receptors (known as 5-HT receptors), increasing activity in the visual parts of the brain, causing dream-like hallucinations and, for some users, inducing a feeling of transcendence.\n\nThe drugs studied in the new meta-analysis primarily included LSD (or lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (a psychedelic compound that occurs naturally in hundreds of species of \"magic\" mushrooms) and ayahuasca (a psychedelic tea made from plants grown in the Amazon, traditionally consumed for ritual or religious purposes).\n\nMultiple studies of all three drug types found several long-term (perhaps permanent) personality changes in individuals who were administered psychedelic drugs compared to individuals who weren't. In particular, individuals who took small doses of psychedelic drugs in a clinical setting scored higher for a personality trait called openness \u2014 the psychological term referring to an appreciation of new experiences \u2014 after their drug trip than nonusers did. In some studies, these personality changes resulted in therapeutic, antidepressant effects, and lasted a year or more. (Research for the included studies was conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Brazil, and German.)\n\n\"This type of research may offer new evidence to the classic discussion on whether personality is or isn\u2019t a constant and stable psychological trait,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe question of whether taking psychedelic drugs can result in long-term personality changes has been studied since at least the 1950s, when the U.S. government famously (and sometimes illegally) tested LSD's potential for human mind control. Research linking personality and drug use increased dramatically in the mid-1980s, the authors wrote in the new review, and personality-test-taking methodologies became more accurate. (This is why the authors focused their search on studies published after 1985.)\n\nSignificantly more research using larger sample sizes is needed before drawing any definitive conclusions about drugs and personality, the researchers wrote. Given that most of the tested substances are still illegal in the U.S., such an analysis is likely many years away.\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/61902-psychedelic-drugs-change-personality.html\n", "\u201cClimate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today,\u201d Mattis said in written answers to questions posed after the public hearing by Democratic members of the committee. \u201cIt is appropriate for the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability that impact the security environment in their areas into their planning.\u201d\n\nMattis has long espoused the position that the armed forces, for a host of reasons, need to cut dependence on fossil fuels and explore renewable energy where it makes sense.

Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Daoust of the University of Edinburgh, U.K., presents these findings in the open-access journal PLOS ONE on July 2, 2020.\n\nAmong those who become ill with COVID-19, older adults appear to be more likely to be hospitalized or die from the disease. Because of their increased vulnerability, one might expect that elderly people would be more disciplined in complying with preventive measures. However, few studies have yet examined their response.\n\nIn the first in-depth study of elderly people's attitudes and compliance with COVID-19 preventative measures, Daoust examined survey results from 72,417 people of all ages across 27 different countries. The surveys asked about people's willingness to self-isolate if necessary, as well as their compliance with specific preventive measures, such as hand washing or wearing a mask.\n\nThe analysis suggests that elderly people are no more willing than those in their 50s and 60s to voluntarily self-isolate if they begin to feel ill or if they are advised to do so by a clinician or health official. People aged 60 to 80 are also less likely than younger age groups to wear a mask outside their home. However, older people are more likely to avoid public transportation and to avoid small gatherings or having guests over.\n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0235590", "In 2000, the measles virus was declared eliminated from the United States. Despite cases coming in from outside the country, there were few outbreaks because most people were vaccinated against measles.

Most cases were among people who were not vaccinated against measles.\n\nAfter events like this, many people express confusion about others' hesitancy or unwillingness to get vaccinated or to vaccinate their children, a concept called vaccine skepticism. As vaccine skepticism has become increasingly widespread, two researchers in the Texas Tech University Department of Psychological Sciences have suggested a possible explanation.\n\nIn an article published recently in the journal Vaccine, Mark LaCour and Tyler Davis suggest some people find vaccines risky because they overestimate the likelihood of negative events, particularly those that are rare.\n\nThe fact that these overestimations carry over through all kinds of negative events - not just those related to vaccines - suggests that people higher in vaccine skepticism actually may process information differently than people lower in vaccine skepticism, said Davis, an associate professor of experimental psychology and director of the Caprock FMRI Laboratory.\n\n\"We might have assumed that people who are high in vaccine skepticism would have overestimated the likelihood of negative vaccine-related events, but it is more surprising that this is true for negative, mortality-related events as a broader category,\" Davis said. \"Here we saw an overestimation of rare events for things that don't have anything to do with vaccination.

At the very start of the coronavirus crisis \u2013 before restrictive measures were taken \u2013 a team of health behaviour specialists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) managed to collect a large amount of data about the adoption of protective measures. Through a study published in the journal Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, the Geneva psychologists analysed how people in Britain followed the precautions recommended in their country. The study focuses on how the behaviour of others influences individual decision-making, known as the social dilemma. It notes that beliefs about COVID-19, such as thinking that the disease is dangerous or feelings of vulnerability, have little impact on whether or not an individual takes up protective measures. The people least likely to adopt these measures are those who believe that the precautions taken by others mean that they do not need to take their own. These psychosocial profiles (among others identified in the study) point to possible solutions for creating prevention messages that are more effective. \n\n \n\nA better understanding of human behaviour when it comes to making a positive contribution to a community can be used to develop more appropriate prevention measures and messaging.

Nitrogen dioxide is a highly reactive gas produced during combustion that has many harmful effects on the lungs. The gas typically enters the atmosphere through emissions from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities.\n\nIn addition to nitrogen dioxide, one of the new studies finds particulate matter pollution (particles smaller than 2.5 microns) has decreased by 35 percent in northern China.

However, for many consumers, luxury purchases can fail to ring true, sparking feelings of inauthenticity that fuel what researchers have labeled the \"impostor syndrome\" among luxury consumers.\n\n\"Luxury can be a double-edged sword,\" write Boston College Carroll School of Management Associate Professor of Marketing Nailya Ordabayeva and her co-authors, Harvard Business School doctoral student Dafna Goor, Boston University professor Anat Keinan, and Hult International Business School professor Sandrine Crener. \"While luxury consumption holds the promise of elevated status, it can backfire and make consumers feel inauthentic, producing what we call the 'impostor syndrome from luxury consumption.'\"\n\nThat's how Ordabayeva and co-authors explain the crux of the projects' findings, published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

The study suggests young people are more likely to be enticed by these deals, and take what they see as an advantageous offer even when they have done nothing wrong.\n\nMost criminal convictions in the UK and the USA occur as the result of guilty pleas, rather than trial. This means the majority of convictions are the result of decisions made by people accused of crimes rather than jurors.\n\nThe research was carried out in the USA, where a system known as \"plea bargaining\" is utilised, but the academics say their discovery has implications for countries across the world that allow teenagers accused of crimes to receive a sentence or charge reduction by pleading guilty. Specifically, the researchers recommend restricting reductions that may entice innocent teenagers into pleading guilty and making it easier for teenagers to change pleas after they have been entered.\n\nOther research has found adolescents are less able to perceive risk and resist the influence of peers because of developmental immaturity.\n\nDr Rebecca Helm, from the University of Exeter Law School, who was part of the research team said: \"It is important to ensure the people accused of crimes have the capacity and freedom to make sensible decisions about whether to plead guilty. Where systems allow defendants to receive a reduced sentence or charge by pleading guilty they need to ensure that defendants are suitably developed to make such decisions and that they have the necessary levels of understanding, reasoning, and appreciation.\n\n\"We hope this research will lead to plea systems becoming fairer and less coercive for adolescents. Any restrictions on guilty pleas for adolescents would have to be introduced in a way that avoids harsher average sentences being imposed on adolescents. However, research increasingly suggests that in the same way as they are too young to vote, too young to drink alcohol, and too young to rent a home, perhaps adolescents are too young to plead guilty.\"\n\nDr Helm and Valerie F. Reyna, Allison A. Franz, and Rachel Z. Novick from Cornell University tested decision making among people of different ages. Participants were 149 adolescents recruited from high schools and middle schools in New York aged from 9 to 17, 200 students from Cornell University aged between 18 and 22, and 187 adults from across America.\n\nParticipants were given the same hypothetical situation in which they were asked to indicate the decisions they would make if accused of a crime. Participants were either asked to imagine they were guilty or not guilty of the crime, and were told the approximate likelihood of conviction at trial and the reductions that could be gained by pleading guilty as opposed to being convicted at trial.\n\nThe research found that as people become older, those who are innocent are less likely to plead guilty. Innocent teenagers indicated that they would plead guilty in roughly one-third of cases, while innocent adults indicated that they would plead guilty in just 18 per cent of cases. Importantly, when examining the decisions researchers found that teenagers were significantly less influenced in their decision-making by whether they were guilty or innocent than adults were. Results also suggest that adolescents are making decisions that do not reflect their values and preferences, including those relating to admitting guilt when innocent, due to developmental immaturity.\n\nAlthough this was an experiment, the academics believe the findings have important implications for the juvenile justice system.\n\nhttp://www.sciencenewsline.com/news/2018031522400080.html", "January 2020 is the third anniversary of the implementation of the new US regulations that require clinical trials to report results within one year of completion (Final Rule of the FDA Amendments Act)--but compliance remains poor, and is not improving, with US Government sponsored trials most likely to breach.\n\nLess than half (41%) of clinical trial results are reported promptly onto the US trial registry, and 1 in 3 trials remain unreported, according to the first comprehensive study of compliance since new US regulations came into effect in January 2017.\n\nThe findings, published in The Lancet, indicate that trials with non-industry sponsors (such as universities, hospitals, and governments) are far more likely to breach the rules than trials sponsored by industry [1]--with US Government sponsored trials least likely to post results on time at the world's largest clinical trial registry, ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nIt has been known for several decades that the results of clinical trials are often not fully reported.

Sexual arousal is also identified as an emotional physical state.   \n\nFindings were established through three different experiments where men processed the scents of axillary sweat samples from anonymous sexually aroused and non-aroused women. Men evaluated the scent of sexually aroused women as relatively more attractive and this increased their sexual motivation. This suggests that the chemical signals of scent alone can elicit a sexual response in recipients.\n\nDr Arnaud Wisman said: \u2018The present studies suggest that men are sensitive to the olfactory signals of sexual arousal released by women. This research suggests that these signals released along with corresponding visual and auditory expressions of sexual interest can produce a stronger overall signal that increases sexual motivation. Sexual interest may entail more than meets the eye and we hope that the current findings encourage further research to examine the role of sexual olfactory signals in human communication.\u2019\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-019-01588-8", "At a large Midwestern high school, almost 40 percent of low-income biology students were poised to fail the course. Instead, thanks to simple measures aimed at reducing test anxiety, that failure rate was halved. \n\nPsychological interventions that improve grades could ultimately help keep more low-income students in the sciences, says Christopher Rozek, a psychologist at Stanford University and lead author of the study, which appears online the week of January 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n\nLow-income students are much less likely than high-income students to complete four years of high school science. That leads to those students being less likely, or unable, to major in science and math in college or to pursue related \u2014 often lucrative \u2014 careers in adulthood. One of the many factors underlying this achievement gap is low-income students\u2019 internalized feelings of inadequacy in such fields, Rozek says. Those feelings often translate to high pretest anxiety and worse grades.   \n\nIn previous, smaller studies, researchers have shown that reducing performance anxiety can improve test scores. To scale up that work, Rozek and colleagues recruited 1,175 freshman biology students at a public high school in Illinois; 285 of those students came from a low socioeconomic background. At the school, slightly over half of low-income students fail their final biology exams compared with just 6 percent of high-income students. \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/01/09/1808589116", "A team of local scientists has found that the size of South Koreans\u2019 heads grew rapidly after Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in 1945. \n\nThe team at the Korea University College of Medicine found that the cranial cavity of a South Korean born in the 1970s was around 90 milliliters bigger than that of a Korean born in the 1930s. \n\nhttp://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&Seq_Code=138559\n\nStudy https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.23464", "In Seattle, Washington, delaying the start time of two high schools by nearly an hour lengthened students' daily sleep by more than half an hour, and was associated with reduced sleepiness and increased academic performance.

The study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry is one of the first to prospectively track over time changes in cognitive function associated with halting cannabis use.\n\n\"Our findings provide two pieces of convincing evidence,\" says Randi Schuster, PhD, director of Neuropsychology at the Center for Addiction Medicine in the MGH Department of Psychiatry, lead author of the paper. \"The first is that adolescents learn better when they are not using cannabis. The second - which is the good news part of the story - is that at least some of the deficits associated with cannabis use are not permanent and actually improve pretty quickly after cannabis use stops.\"\n\nThe authors note that the use of cannabis among adolescents is common, with more than 13 percent of middle and high school students reporting cannabis use in a recent survey and rates of daily use increasing between grades 8 and 12. But adolescence is a critical time for brain maturation, specifically for brain regions that are most susceptible to the effects of cannabis. A 2016 study from the same research team found that cannabis users aged 16 and under had difficulty learning new information, a problem that was not observed in users age 17 and older.\n\nThe current study is the first one able to determine not only whether cognitive improvement occurs but also when during abstinence this improvement is detectable. The study enrolled 88 participants ages 16 to 25 from the Boston area, all of whom acknowledged using cannabis at least once a week. Investigators compared weekly cognitive performance between a group of young cannabis users who agreed to stop their use for 30 days and a group that continued to use cannabis. To ensure that the two groups were as comparable as possible, they were randomized in a way that controlled for factors such as pre-existing differences in learning, mood, cognition and motivation, and the frequency and intensity of cannabis use.\n\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/mgh-omo102418.php\n\nStudy https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2018/v79/17m11977.aspx", "\nPermafrost hs begun thawing in the Canadian Arctic more than 70 years early because of climate change, according to new research. \n\nA \"series of anomalously warm summers\u201d has dramatically accelerated melting rates at three sites despite average annual ground temperatures remaining low.

In that survey, individuals were asked to rank the relative causes of violent death in their state over the past year. The data were then compared to each state's official death count. The results indicated that although suicide was more common than homicide in all 50 states, the majority of respondents did not identify it as such.\n\n\"The relative frequencies that respondents reported didn't match up with the state's data when we compared them to vital statistics,\" Morgan said. \"The inconsistency between the true causes and what the public perceives to be frequent causes of death indicates a gap in knowledge and a place where additional education can be helpful.\"\n\nResearchers say education about the actual risks is critical. If people believe homicide is the top risk, for example, they might purchase a gun to protect themselves. And without an understanding of the high risk of suicide, people may be less inclined to store firearms safely.\n\nTo Morgan and her colleagues, this education on firearm risks needs to extend to the media and entertainment industries.\n\nhttps://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-10/uow-smp102918.php\n\nStudy http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2709820/reducing-firearm-injuries-deaths-united-states-position-paper-from-american"], "-eDgAR-": ["Sometimes we use the stream of our pee to try and clean poop stains on the bottom of toilet bowls.

This type of emergency hatch demonstrates that these baby amphibians have survival instincts at a young age.\n\n[Source](https://youtu.be/9V6jZpO2gSk)", "Video by @sofya\\_yokoyama on Instagram", "Stop Playing God!", " [Source](https://youtu.be/yjtunKxS_PU)", "Not cool of OP\n\nEdit:I was at work and generic excuse but someone posted it before i could,i am very sad honestly", "Please no more!\n\nalso you can find more vids from him here: [cznburak](https://www.instagram.com/cznburak)", " [Source](https://www.facebook.com/CenterforBioDiv/videos/697445937279350/) Leaf-cutter bees are solitary, gentle pollinators that opt to construct egg chambers out of leaves, which they provision with nectar and pollen. Once these are in place, the female leaf-cutter places a single egg atop the food she\u2019s gathered and then caps the cell with circular pieces of leaves. She may construct as many  as 20 of these pollen-filled bee-ritos before she\u2019s done. This footage shows a young leaf-cutter emerging from it's cozy bee-rito in the UK.
